        "description": "<p>Leveraging its passable bulk, amazing typing, solid movepool, and two fantastic abilities in Magic Guard and Unaware, Clefable establishes its niche in the OU tier as a solid glue on bulkier team compositions, which appreciate its amazing role compression. Clefable maximizes its physical bulk to handle a myriad of physical attackers and passive Pokemon such as Great Tusk, Hisuian Samurott, Gliscor, and Garganacl. Clefable is an effective Stealth Rock user, as it threatens Great Tusk and can punish Corviknight with paralysis, lock it into Defog with Encore, or remove its item. Knock Off removes Heavy-Duty Boots to enable Clefable's Stealth Rock and teammates' Spikes. Clefable primarily uses Encore on Unaware sets, as it can force setup sweepers like Raging Bolt into uncomfortable positions, allowing one of its teammates to get a safe switch into the field. Thunder Wave cripples faster Pokemon like Zamazenta, Roaring Moon, and Weavile. While Moonlight is usually preferred as Clefable's recovery, Wish and Protect can be used over Moonlight and Stealth Rock, respectively, if Clefable's team already has another Stealth Rock user. Calm Mind can be used on Unaware sets to handle special-boosting attackers such as Darkrai and Hatterene. Sticky Barb + Trick can also be used on Magic Guard sets to incapacitate Gliscor, as Sticky Barb neutralizes Poison Heal recovery, crippling Gliscor's longevity; it also punishes common switch-ins like Galarian Slowking, Clodsire, and Blissey while also generally being useful to steal items. Clefable uses Tera Water and Tera Steel to absorb Steel-type attacks in a pinch like Kingambit's Iron Head, Gholdengo's Make It Rain, and Iron Treads's Steel Beam. Tera Water is preferred due to its good matchups into the physical attackers Clefable aims to check, letting Clefable switch into Barraskewda and Cinderace while granting a good neutral defensive typing. Tera Steel can also be used to become immune to Poison-type attacks like Galarian Slowking's Sludge Bomb, but it loses key matchups like Cinderace, Great Tusk, and Landorus-T. Tera Ghost is also a decent pick, as it preserves Clefable’s good matchups into Fighting-types while also letting it spinblock, but it has a worse matchup against Knock Off users. It's worth noting that Clefable prefers not to Terastallize unless it absolutely needs to, as its base typing is incredibly valuable. Rocky Helmet is also viable on Magic Guard sets as an effective way to punish U-turn and as a one time Knock Off punisher, although Clefable usually prefers Leftovers letting it beat stronger Pokemon one-on-one without needing to use Moonlight as frequently.</p> <p>Clefable fits on balance and stall teams that appreciate its role compression and typing. Teammates like Skarmory, Gliscor, and Clodsire love Clefable’s ability to remove Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off and enable their entry hazards. Gliscor, in particular, is a phenomenal teammate. The two are effective walls that cover each other’s physical weaknesses; Clefable can switch into Knock Off from threats that Gliscor cannot handle, namely Meowscarada, Great Tusk, Hisuian Samurott, and Weavile, threatening them out with Moonblast. In return, Gliscor can set Spikes, which when combined with Clefable’s Stealth Rock and the pair’s access to Knock Off, forms a potent hazard-stacking core. Galarian Slowking is similarly a good partner, as Clefable can handle many of the aforementioned Dark-types that threaten it. In return Galarian Slowking is an amazing special wall that switches into many strong special attacks that would threaten Clefable, such as Iron Moth's Sludge Wave and Primarina's Moonblast. It can also spread Toxic, which allows Clefable to stay in against physical attackers more comfortably. Encore’s ability to catch setup sweepers is appreciated by Clefable’s more offensively oriented teammates like Kingambit and Dragapult to give them a safe entry point. Additionally, it lets in more defensively oriented Pokemon, notably Alomomola, which can regenerate HP and pass Wish. Offensive partners appreciate Thunder Wave support to enable them to punish faster Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Iron Boulder, and opposing Dragapult. In exchange, Weavile and Meowscarada can remove Heavy-Duty Boots so Clefable's Stealth Rock can start racking up damage. Dragapult and Gholdengo are also effective partners, as they pressure or cripple common Pokemon that annoy Clefable and can also spinblock Great Tusk and Iron Treads. In return, Clefable threatens Dark-types while also forcing out Garganacl. Kingambit is a phenomenal partner, as it threatens common answers to Clefable such as Clodsire, Blissey, Galarian Slowking, and Gholdengo. Zamazenta pressures Iron Treads, Kingambit, and Heatran while equally enjoying Clefable handling Great Tusk and pestering Dragapult. Dragonite is also a decent partner, as it likes Clefable's ability to check and pressure Dragon-types as well as its Encore support, giving it more setup opportunities.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With its unique combination of Aurora Veil, Snow Warning, and a good Speed tier, Alolan Ninetales establishes itself as a premiere lead for setting Aurora Veil, giving it the advantage over fellow dual screens setters like Grimmsnarl and Deoxys-S, which require two turns instead to set up. Encore shuts down setup sweepers that try to take advantage of Alolan Ninetales's mediocre offensive presence like Kingambit and punishes defensive Pokemon like Ting-Lu, Garganacl, and Corviknight, giving Alolan Ninetales's teammates free opportunities to set up. Freeze-Dry threatens common leads like Landorus-T, Hisuian Samurott, and Gliscor as well as Pelipper, which otherwise removes Alolan Ninetales's snow unthreatened. Freeze-Dry can also target certain threats like Ogerpon-W and Walking Wake. Moonblast serves as a stronger secondary STAB option to slam threats like Darkrai, Zamazenta, and Weavile that Freeze-Dry cannot while hitting Hisuian Samurott slightly harder. Alternatively, Snowscape can be run over either STAB move, allowing Alolan Ninetales to reset snow in the face of weather setters Torkoal, Ninetales, Pelipper, and Tyranitar, ensuring both Aurora Veil and the advantage in the weather wars. Though Alolan Ninetales rarely wants to Terastallize, Tera Water is run to shed its Fire and Steel weaknesses, flipping the matchup on Pokemon like Iron Moth, Gholdengo, and Scizor.</p> <p>With its invaluable ability to set dual screens in one turn, Alolan Ninetales cements itself as a lead for hyper offense teams. One sweeper that pairs exceptionally well with Alolan Ninetales is Kyurem, as its Dragon Dance set heavily appreciates both Aurora Veil and snow extending its already solid bulk to absurd levels. Other setup sweepers like Zamazenta, Kingambit, Raging Bolt, and Roaring Moon similarly enjoy Aurora Veil, able to boost with near impunity then crush the opposing team. In particular, Bulk Up Great Tusk is an excellent teammate for its added entry hazard removal in Rapid Spin, which Aurora Veil teams can otherwise struggle with. Rillaboom combines Grassy Terrain's recovery with Aurora Veil to allow even more opportunities for its teammates to set up with ease, which is especially useful for those weak to Earthquake like the aforementioned Raging Bolt and Kingambit. However, Alolan Ninetales's biggest foe, Cinderace, resists both of its STAB moves and can steal Aurora Veil with Court Change. Other major threats include Iron Moth and Steel-types like Gholdengo, Iron Crown, and Scizor, which similarly ignore Alolan Ninetales's attacks, can threaten an OHKO, and, in Iron Moth's case, can set up a Substitute freely. Thus, a great partner is Manaphy, which is able to shrug off any Steel- and Fire-type attacks while synergizing well with Aurora Veil, especially for its Double Dance set. Iron Moth easily boosts on Cinderace and threatens Steel-types, as well as snowballing through sun and Sticky Web teams that would otherwise give Alolan Ninetales trouble; Aurora Veil allows Iron Moth to take a hit or two, which is especially useful for the Substitute variants. Dragonite can serve as a useful check to Iron Moth, offensive Cinderace, and other offensive threats with its powerful Extreme Speed. Another Pokemon to watch out for is Corviknight, which can remove Aurora Veil with Defog, so teammates like the aforementioned Iron Moth and Raging Bolt are useful to pressure it from ever entering the field and using Defog freely.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Due to its unique traits, Galarian Weezing manages to carve out a niche of its own as an entry hazard remover. Its main appeal is Neutralizing Gas, which makes it the only hazard remover able to remove hazards in front of Gholdengo. Neutralizing Gas is also able to help it in other matchups against ability-reliant foes, such as Alomomola, Garganacl, and Rillaboom. Pain Split is its only way of healing, and both Will-O-Wisp and Toxic help it get a turn to remove hazards by forcing out opposing threats; Will-O-Wisp scares off physical attackers like Ogerpon-W, Landorus-T and Kingambit, and Toxic scares off Pokemon that are immune to Will-O-Wisp or not threatened by its Attack drop, like Moltres, Cinderace, and Primarina. 16 Special Attack EVs guarantee the OHKO against Naive Iron Valiant with Strange Steam. Heavy-Duty Boots is crucial due to its hazard-removing role, as it lets Galarian Weezing switch in without being chipped down by the hazards it needs to remove. Tera Flying covers its major weakness against Ground-type moves, letting it take on threats like Landorus-T and Great Tusk, while also keeping its Fighting resistance, which helps it against foes like Zamazenta.</p> <p>Galarian Weezing fits on balance teams due to its role as an entry hazard remover with a good defensive profile, so teammates that don't use Heavy-Duty Boots appreciate it removing hazards, such as Ting-Lu, Darkrai, Ogerpon-W, and Raging Bolt. Galarian Weezing is able to absorb Dragon-, Fighting-, and Dark-type attacks from the likes of Dragapult, Hisuian Samurott, Iron Valiant, and Zamazenta, and due to Galarian Weezing being a Poison-neutral Fairy-type, it is able to soft check Darkrai too. Ting-Lu helps it by taking on the special attackers of the tier, like Gholdengo, Iron Moth, and Iron Crown, which all target Galarian Weezing on its weaker Special Defense, while it can't do anything back. Galarian Weezing helps Ting-Lu taking on Fighting-type threats that threaten it, like Iron Valiant and Zamazenta, as well as Grass-type wallbreakers like the Ogerpon formes. Gliscor and Garganacl can be paired with Galarian Weezing, as it deals with bulky Grass-types like Ogerpon-Wellspring, Sinistcha, and Hydrapple that can threaten them. Ogerpon-W serves as a good offensive partner for Galarian Weezing, physically breaking Ground-types that bother Galarian Weezing like Ting-Lu and Iron Treads, while Galarian Weezing can help it against problematic matchups like Zamazenta, Dragapult, and bulky Grass-types such as Sinistcha and Hydrapple. Partners like Kyurem and Darkrai also help Galarian Weezing by specially breaking through Ground-types, like Great Tusk and Landorus-T, while Galarian Weezing helps it back by walling Zamazenta and Iron Valiant. Corviknight and Skarmory can help it deal defensively with Ground-type foes like Great Tusk, Landorus-T and Iron Treads that threaten Galarian Weezing with their STAB Ground-type moves. Raging Bolt likes the help from Galarian Weezing pressuring Ground-types, which helps it in wallbreaking later. Alomomola appreciates Galarian Weezing taking on the Grass-types in the tier like Ogerpon-W, Hydrapple, and Sinistcha, while Alomomola is able to take on foes like Landorus-T, Great Tusk and Kingambit. Gholdengo helps Galarian Weezing in dealing with Psychic-types like Hatterene, Iron Crown, and Deoxys-S, and it appreciates Galarian Weezing checking foes like Hisuian Samurott and Darkrai. Zamazenta helps Galarian Weezing by beating Steel-types like Kingambit, Iron Treads, and Heatran; in return, Galarian Weezing deals with problematic matchups like Iron Valiant.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Zapdos is a defensive pivot that is able to take hits, spread status, and build momentum for its team. Volt Switch is a strong option for a pivoting move, being both STAB-boosted and non-contact, but U-turn is a solid alternative to avoid being blocked by Ground-types if Zapdos already has Discharge as its STAB move. Thunder Wave is a powerful support move for slowing down the opposing team, whereas Heat Wave gives Zapdos a coverage option against Steel-types like Iron Treads and Kingambit, which can be 2HKOed by it. Heavy-Duty Boots is important for mitigating Zapdos's weakness to Stealth Rock. Tera Steel gives Zapdos favorable matchups against foes like Kyurem and Galarian Slowking, allowing it to resist attacks like Ice Beam and become immune to status moves like Toxic while giving it the opportunity to spread paralysis, which it may not have been able to do otherwise. Tera Fairy is very useful for giving Zapdos a Dark resistance, allowing it to take hits from Roaring Moon's Knock Off and Kingambit's Kowtow Cleave, thus providing more chances for Static to activate. Most of the EVs are put into Zapdos's Defense, with 16 Speed EVs allowing it to outspeed base 70s like Volcanion and Sinistcha.</p> <p>Zapdos is extremely useful on balance teams. Galarian Slowking is an excellent choice of teammate to tank special attacks from threats like Kyurem and Iron Valiant, while Zapdos can help it in return by switching into Ground-type moves that threaten it from Pokemon like Great Tusk and Landorus-T, pivoting back and forth between each other to support this. Zapdos can also form strong defensive cores with other bulky Pokemon like Zamazenta and Ting-Lu. Zamazenta is able to deal with less favorable matchups for Zapdos, such as Kyurem and Weavile, and Zapdos is able to help by pivoting to it safely. Ting-Lu can support Zapdos by setting entry hazards that can wear down foes like Gholdengo and Walking Wake so that they can be KOed by Zapdos more easily. Hex Gholdengo becomes much stronger with Zapdos as a paralysis-spreading partner, and it is then able to support Zapdos and its teammates with speed control, taking out threats like Dragapult and Darkrai. Zapdos struggles to make progress against common Ground-types like Gliscor, which are immune to Volt Switch, thus preventing it from pivoting. Gliscor can also threaten Zapdos with Knock Off. Teammates like Weavile and Kyurem are great at putting pressure on these counters, and they in turn appreciate Zapdos's ability to get them in safely. While Weavile and Kyurem make good teammates, they also make difficult foes for Zapdos, both of them outspeeding and KOing it. The aforementioned Zamazenta as well as Kingambit can put pressure on these threats. In exchange, Zapdos can help by taking hits from Pokemon like Great Tusk and opposing Zamazenta and crippling these threats with Static and Thunder Wave, giving a teammate like Kingambit more chances to sweep. Knock Off users like Roaring Moon threaten to remove Zapdos's Heavy-Duty Boots. Pokemon that can take hits from Knock Off, like Clefable and Gliscor, are great at helping Zapdos avoid this.</p>"

Its typing and ability let it punish a multitude of physical attackers in the tier, threatening a burn with Flame Body to stop pivoting from U-turn or reliably walling the likes of Zamazenta lacking Stone Edge, Great Tusk, Enamorus, Rillaboom, and Iron Valiant. Hurricane can be used to threaten foes like Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Ogerpon-W hard. Will-O-Wisp reliably cripples physical attackers like Terastallized Kingambit, Ogerpon-W, and Dragonite. Roar stops potential setup sweepers like Tera Fire Zamazenta and Iron Moth, as well as being a good way to deal passive damage if entry hazards are up. U-turn lets Moltres get in teammates safely. Scorching Sands can be used to hit foes like Heatran and Raging Bolt and can fish for burns against most physical attackers. Tera Fairy is a solid defensive typing that gives Moltres a Dark resistance while keeping its natural Fighting resistance, maintaining its positive matchup versus Zamazenta. This lets Moltres check Dark-type physical attacker like Weavile, Roaring Moon, and Kingambit in a pinch. Tera Grass flips Moltres's weakness to Water into a resistance, giving it an easier rain matchup, as well as taking various hits like Hydro Steam from Walking Wake, Ivy Cudgel from Ogerpon-W, and Water-type moves from Primarina to Roar out Calm Mind variants. It also flips Moltres's Electric weakness against Raging Bolt, letting it phaze Calm Mind variants with Roar. Terastallization allows Moltres to ease its weakness to Knock Off and Stealth Rock, letting it not fear huge chip damage from them.</p> <p>Moltres is a great fit on offensive teams and more bulky teams. Its great typing and its ability to spread burn help its teammates against prominent physical attackers. Partners like Clefable and Kingambit appreciate it being able to check threats like Great Tusk and opposing Kingambit, while Clefable and Kingambit are able to switch into threats to Moltres, such as Weavile and Roaring Moon. Offensive partners like Ogerpon-W and Zamazenta appreciate Moltres's pivoting, forcing in Pokemon like Garganacl and Heatran, which have bad matchups against the aforementioned teammates. Zamazenta is also able to check Ogerpon-W with its ability's initial Defense boost. Darkrai and Weavile are also potent offensive partners, being able to amend Moltres's bad matchups such as Gliscor and Galarian Slowking by threatening huge damage on both targets. Threats to Moltres are potent attackers such as Primarina and Ogerpon-W. A partner like Galarian Slowking works well with Moltres, as it enjoys burns allowing it to switch into physical attackers, such as a burned Zamazenta, as well as being able to switch into attacks from Primarina. Offensive threats like Ogerpon and Dragapult can check Ogerpon-W, either helping in taking attacks, revenge killing, or crippling it with status. Defensive partners such as Gliscor, Great Tusk, and Corviknight can switch into Knock Off for Moltres, with Gliscor itself being able to use Knock Off and set Spikes, which pairs well with Roar variants of Moltres. Great Tusk and Corviknight offer entry hazard removal. Ground-types like Clodsire and Ting-Lu are able to cover Moltres's bad matchups against Electric-types like Raging Bolt and Zapdos, as well as providing hazards, which make Moltres's phazing more of a threat.</p>"

After one Nasty Plot boost, it can 2HKO the likes of Assault Vest Galarian Slowking and Curse Garganacl, and after one Agility boost, it can outspeed would-be faster Pokemon such as +1 Iron Valiant, Choice Scarf Gholdengo, and +1 Walking Wake. Tera Blast Fairy lets it OHKO Hoopa-U while also being able to net 2HKOs on Kingambit, Assault Vest Hoopa-U, and Dragonite, all after one Nasty Plot boost. Tera Fairy also maintains its Dark resistance while letting it potentially set up in the face of Dragon-type attacks from foes like Dragapult. Alternatively, Hurricane is a strong neutral STAB move that prevents Galarian Moltres form relying too much on Terastallization to function. Tera Dark boosts Fiery Wrath's power, being able to OHKO Assault Vest Galarian Slowking after a Nasty Plot boost and Stealth Rock damage, as well as being able to 2HKO specially defensive Moltres and Assault Vest Toxapex after a Nasty Plot boost. Tera Flying is only to be used if running Hurricane, which can OHKO Zamazenta without a Nasty Plot boost, as well as non-Assault Vest Azumarill and Enamorus after a Nasty Plot boost. Sitrus Berry lets it set up much more easily, and can potentially let it trigger Berserk twice. Heavy-Duty Boots allows it to ignore Stealth Rock. Finally, Weakness Policy is a viable alternative if running dual screens support to take on super effective hits more comfortably. Because of its reliance on setup, Galarian Moltres is best utilized on hyper offense teams. Hence, it appreciates entry hazard support from suicide leads such as Glimmora, Hisuian Samurott, and Meowscarada so that incoming foes can be worn down for Galarian Moltres to clean. Dual screens from Dragapult lets it setup much more easily, esepcially for Weakness Policy variants. Hazard control is a must when running Galarian Moltres due to its vulnerability to Stealth Rock, so it appreciates partners such as Great Tusk and Hatterene with their access to Rapid Spin and Magic Bounce. The two of them can also threaten special walls that can hinder a Galarian Moltres sweep, with Great Tusk being able to OHKO Galarian Slowking and 2HKO Ting-Lu, while Hatterene can 2HKO Clodsire. In return, Galarian Moltres can set up on and threaten Zamazenta for Great Tusk and Gholdengo for Hatterene. Bulky Unaware users such as Dondozo as well as special walls like Garganacl prevent Galarian Moltres from performing its sweep. Hence, offensive Zapdos pairs well with Galarian Moltres, being able to 2HKO both of the aforementioned Pokemon, provided Garganacl is Tera Water. Lastly, Galarian Moltres can facilitate sweeps from physically oriented sweepers like Kingambit by removing obstacles like Great Tusk and Gholdengo.</p>"

        "description": "<p>As a bulky setup Pokemon with a vast movepool including some of the strongest priority in the tier in Extreme Speed, Dragon Dance Dragonite is a great cleaner for all manner of offensive teams. After a Dragon Dance, Dragonite outspeeds and threatens many common offensive Pokemon like non-Choice Scarf Meowscarada, Roaring Moon, and even Dragapult if using a Jolly nature. Extreme Speed is Dragonite's defining move, giving it a very strong and spammable attack that outruns other priority moves while hitting most of the tier for neutral damage. After Dragon Dance and Extreme Speed, Dragonite can pick from a wide range of coverage and utility moves depending on the team it finds itself on. Earthquake gives Dragonite a strong way to hit Steel-types that resist Extreme Speed like Heatran, Kingambit, and Gholdengo while also giving Dragonite better immediate damage into bulky threats like Raging Bolt, Garganacl, and Skeledirge that take little damage from its other moves. Fire Punch allows Dragonite to threaten Skarmory due to its Earthquake immunity, as well as Air Balloon Steel-types like Gholdengo. Ice Spinner is the only way for Dragonite to immediately threaten tier staple Gliscor, which otherwise easily stalls out Dragonite with Toxic + Protect. It is also Dragonite's strongest option into most opposing Dragon-types like opposing Dragonite, prevents Landorus-T from repeatedly switching in with Intimidate, and wears down Great Tusk quicker than other common coverage options. Roost is an option for teams that rely more on Dragonite defensively, letting it use its myriad resists to take on the likes of Ogerpon-W and Rillaboom multiple times in a game while restoring Multiscale. Encore helps Dragonite to pressure walls, entry hazard setters, and setup sweepers like Dondozo, Gliscor, and Bulk Up Great Tusk. Dragon Claw is a STAB move with no drawbacks and good neutral coverage for two attack sets that want to use utility moves, Outrage gives Dragonite better breaking power against bulky neutral targets like Dondozo at the cost of being locked into the move, Hurricane can snag a surprise OHKO on Great Tusk and deal huge damage to Zamazenta, and Brick Break can OHKO even bulky Kingambit at +1. Dragonite can be tailored to fit nearly any offensive team; it cannot beat every Pokemon in any one set, it can choose to beat just about anything. Dragonite primarily runs Tera Normal to boost Extreme Speed into a strong STAB move, as it lacks a reliable STAB option otherwise. The boost also allows +1 Dragonite to OHKO otherwise threatening Pokemon like Weavile. Tera Normal also removes all of Dragonite's existing weaknesses, allowing it to set up on practically any Pokemon in the tier. Multiscale makes Dragonite nearly impossible to OHKO, providing it with a safe setup turn even in the face of some of the tier's strongest threats like Gholdengo and Darkrai while also making it a great revenge killer.</p> <p>Dragonite primarily features on bulky offense or hyper offense, where it provides defensive utility alongside threatening to sweep. In general, Dragonite's best use is against opposing offensive teams. For hyper offense, Its bulk allows it to trade for most offensive Pokemon in a pinch, and Extreme Speed picks off most fast and frail threats. It allows the team to focus less on fighting opposing offense and frees up team slots for Pokemon that match up better into bulkier styles. For bulky offense, it checks dangerous Grass- and Water-types such as Rillaboom and Ogerpon-W that can threaten frailer defensive cores while also revenge killing sweepers. Dragonite is quite weak to Garganacl, as it takes little damage from Dragonite's moves except Earthquake, which it can avoid by Terastallizing, while threatening Salt Cure and hazards, so it appreciates Pokemon like Gliscor that can heal off Salt Cure damage and force it out. Other setup sweepers sweepers like Taunt Roaring Moon can also help to overwhelm Garganacl. Primarina is a similar case, not fearing most of Dragonite's options while threating a strong STAB Moonblast or Draining Kiss in return, but it can be dealt with by teammates like Ogerpon-W and Raging Bolt. Bulkier Pokemon and teams in general give Dragonite a lot of issues, as without a high power STAB move, it cannot break though bulky neutral targets. Because of this, it appreciates Knock Off support that can force in and chip bulky Water- and Fairy-types like Dondozo and Clefable; offensive Great Tusk and Weavile both fit in this role. Dragonite benefits greatly from entry hazard setters like Glimmora, Hisuian Samurott, and Landorus-T. Dragonite should almost always be paired with a Steel- or Fire-type, as they complement Dragonite's typing well and help to deal with problematic Pokemon like Weavile and Enamorus. Kingambit provides this support while also dealing with Ghost-types like Skeledirge and Dragapult that often stop Dragonite. Tera Dark Kingambit with Black Glasses also forces progress against almost all of the physically defensive Pokemon like Corviknight that Dragonite struggles to break. Nasty Plot Gholdengo similarly offers a good defensive pivot for Dragonite while blocking hazard removal to assist with the hazard stacking that Dragonite benefits from, and it also threatens bulkier styles well with boosted STAB moves. Heatran is another excellent teammate on bulkier offense teams, as it can provide Dragonite with entry hazard support while threatening its checks such as Clefable and Skarmory, in addition to forcing out revenge killers like Weavile. Iron Valiant is also notable as it threatens out physically defensive Pokemon such as Great Tusk and provides Knock Off support.</p>"

      "Scale Shot": {
        "description": "<p>Utilizing Loaded Dice and Scale Shot, Dragonite speeds through OU, flying circles around traditional Dragonite checks like Corviknight, Zamazenta, and Gholdengo. Scale Shot gives Dragonite a powerful STAB move to hit many threats, OHKOing its fellow Dragon-types like Roaring Moon and Raging Bolt and, after a Dragon Dance, the likes of Ogerpon-W and Darkrai. Furthermore, after a Speed boost from Scale Shot or Dragon Dance, Dragonite can outspeed almost the entirety of the unboosted metagame, excluding Dragapult, Zamazenta, and Deoxys-S, and further usage of Scale Shot can make it extremely difficult to outspeed Dragonite without priority. Fire Punch slams the Steel-types that Scale Shot misses, like Corviknight, Gholdengo, and Kingambit. Finally, Encore shuts down both defensive and offensive Pokemon that dare to set up or recover on Dragonite, like Corviknight, Zamazenta, and Garganacl. Loaded Dice ensures Scale Shot is a reliable damaging move. Tera Fire boosts Fire Punch, pushing Corviknight into the 2HKO range and guaranteeing the 2HKO on Skarmory, Gholdengo, and Kingambit, and nullifies Cinderace's and Moltres's Will-O-Wisp, allowing Dragonite to turn potential checks into setup opportunities. Due to Scale Shot's Speed-boosting side effect, Dragonite can comfortably run an Adamant nature, guaranteeing the OHKO on threats like Walking Wake.</p> <p>With its power and versatility, Scale Shot Dragonite finds itself on bulky offense and hyper offense teams. Due to Dragonite's lack of Heavy-Duty Boots, entry hazard control is more important than ever to maintain both Multiscale and to avoid chip damage, so hazard control teammates like Iron Treads, Great Tusk, and Hatterene are crucial, with the latter also serving as a status blocker from pesky defensive Pokemon like Moltres and Gliscor. Speaking of status spreaders, Dragapult is a flight hazard for Dragonite, with a speedy Will-O-Wisp and devastating Dragon Darts, so partners like Primarina and Iron Valiant are solid picks to scare it away. An exceptional partner for Dragonite is Landorus-T, which brings hazard support in Stealth Rock, a fast Taunt that can deny Stealth Rock from setters like Glimmora and Ting Lu, and the ability to bring Dragonite in safely through U-turn. Other strong partners for Dragonite are Gholdengo and Iron Crown, as they can scare threats like Iron Valiant and Zamazenta, which Dragonite often struggles to switch into; the latter also works as a pivot through Volt Switch. Similarly, Dragonite also enjoys pairing with Galarian Slowking, which threatens Iron Valiant, Primarina and other Fairy-types that halt Dragonite's attack and can also pivot with Chilly Reception. Dragonite crushes its fellow Dragon-types like Roaring Moon, as well as other physical walls like Gholdengo and Skarmory, clearing the way for teammates like Ogerpon-W to wreak havoc. Dragonite can also take advantage of Water- and Grass-types like Rillaboom and Ogerpon-W, covering for defensive partners like Primarina, Landorus-T, and Great Tusk. Kingambit also appreciates Dragonite as a teammate, as Dragonite can lure in checks like Cinderace and Moltres before flipping the tables with Tera Fire, allowing for an easier late-game sweep with Kingambit.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Galarian Slowking is an excellent defensive pivot thanks to good Special Defense, Regenerator, and a solid defensive typing. Future Sight allows Galarian Slowking to pressure a number of offensive threats like Iron Valiant, Great Tusk, and Zamazenta and do significant damage to defensive foes like Toxapex and Clodsire. Chilly Reception alongside minimum Speed investment allows Galarian Slowking to serve as the metagame's slowest pivot, able to safely bring in offensive teammates safely while changing the weather to snow, which disrupts weather archetypes like rain and sun. Galarian Slowking has a number of options for its last move: Thunder Wave allows it to cripple fast offensive threats like Dragapult and Weavile while preventing Kingambit from freely switching into Galarian Slowking, Toxic wears down opposing walls like Ting-Lu and Dondozo as well as Thunder Wave-immune targets like Raging Bolt, and Slack Off offers immediate recovery, allowing Galarian Slowking to stay on the field longer. Tera Water lets Galarian Slowking stand up to powerful Fire-types like Cinderace as well as offensive Water-types like Walking Wake, while Tera Fairy gives it an immunity to strong Dragon-type attacks from the likes of Walking Wake and Raging Bolt. Tera Dark is another option that turns Galarian Slowking's Dark- and Ghost-type weaknesses into resistances, making it more resilient against foes like Greninja and Dragapult. 16 Defense EVs allow Galarian Slowking to live a Knock Off from Meowscarada.</p> <p>Galarian Slowking is an excellent choice for a pivot on balance teams, as frail offensive teammates like Iron Valiant appreciate being brought in safely as well as the pressure applied by Future Sight. Due to its average Defense, Galarian Slowking benefits from physically defensive partners like Skarmory to form a solid defensive core. Galarian Slowking struggles against special walls like Ting-Lu and Skeledirge if not running Toxic, so physically offensive teammates like Weavile and Hisuian Samurott that can take care of them make good partners. Additionally, Galarian Slowking is walled by Steel-types like Corviknight and Heatran, so teammates like Raging Bolt and Great Tusk that can remove them are necessary. Ground-immune teammates like Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Corviknight are also good partners for Galarian Slowking due to its weakness to common threats like Great Tusk and opposing Gliscor.</p>"

      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<p>Assault Vest Galarian Slowking can blanket check hard-hitting special attackers like Walking Wake and Enamorus, with Regenerator allowing it to maintain longevity throughout the course of a game. Moreover, the added bulk from Assault Vest means Galarian Slowking can afford to invest into its Special Attack, improving its offensive prowess significantly by making use of its colorful coverage options to be a respectable special attacker as well. Psyshock punches holes through special walls like opposing Galarian Slowking, Blissey, and Clodsire much more effectively than its other Psychic-type STAB options and also immediately threatens Iron Moth, which can snowball past Galarian Slowking if given enough turns. It also allows Galarian Slowking to handle threatening Calm Mind users like Raging Bolt and Iron Valiant that can otherwise break past it with enough boosts. Sludge Bomb's poison can prove devastating against bulkier foes like Alomomola and Ting-Lu that can otherwise switch into Galarian Slowking. Flamethrower is useful coverage to hit Steel-types like Kingambit and Gholdengo, which would otherwise have ample switch-in opportunities. Ice Beam allows Galarian Slowking to hit Ground-types like Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Great Tusk while denting foes like Dragapult, Dragonite, and Roaring Moon. 16 Defense EVs let Galarian Slowking survive a Knock Off from non-Choice Band Meowscarada and 64 Special Defense EVs allow it to take two +1 Raging Bolt's Thunderbolt after Stealth Rock and two Choice Specs Speed-boosting Walking Wake's Hydro Steam in sun. The rest of its EVs are pooled into Special Attack, letting it reach feats such as OHKOing Speed-boosting Iron Moth with Psyshock; 2HKOing Darkrai and, after minor chip damage, OHKOing Ogerpon-W and Rillaboom with Sludge Bomb; 2HKOing Iron Crown and bulky variants of Gholdengo and Kingambit with Flamethrower; and potentially OHKOing even specially defensive Gliscor with Ice Beam. Tera Water gives Galarian Slowking a resistance to Water and Fire, allowing it to check Pokemon like Walking Wake, Primarina, and Iron Moth better, and drops its weaknesses to Dark-, Ground-, and Ghost-type moves, which allows it to act as an emergency check to Pokemon like Darkrai, Dragapult, and Great Tusk.</p> <p>Galarian Slowking is a recommended pick for balance and bulky offense teams due to it being able to check multiple top metagame threats like special attacking Iron Valiant, Iron Moth, and Walking Wake while also having respectable offensive presence and respectable longevity. It has a lot of trouble dealing with Ground-type Pokemon like Great Tusk and Landorus-T, so Flying-types like Corviknight and Skarmory pair extremely well with it. Corviknight and Skarmory are also able to sponge physical attacks from other Pokemon Galarian Slowking struggles with like Roaring Moon, Dragonite, and Kingambit. Offensive partners like Rillaboom and Primarina can hit Ground-types instead of just simply walling them. Great Tusk itself is a great teammate for Galarian Slowking on the balance teams they fit on, serving as a Kingambit check and as entry hazard removal, especially versus hazard stacking teams. In return, Galarian Slowking is able to beat Pokemon like Enamorus, Walking Wake, and special attacking Iron Valiant sets for Great Tusk. Dragapult pairs neatly with Galarian Slowking, since it's also a frequent balance pick, serves as useful speed control, and appreciates Galarian Slowking being able to spread poison thanks to Sludge Bomb, allowing it to fire off Hex more frequently late-game without fearing Fairy-types stopping its sweeps. Gliscor fits on balance builds with Galarian Slowking, serving as a blanket check to physical attackers, a hazard setter, and a Knock Off absorber, along with having great longevity. Galarian Slowking is able to take advantage of the hazards Gliscor sets up by forcing switches with its vast array of coverage options, since many offensive threats prone to taking hazard damage like Primarina, Enamorus, Iron Valiant, and Raging Bolt don't want to stay in and take repeated hits from it. Landorus-T is the Ground / Flying teammate of choice on bulky offense teams because of its better offensive presence and pivoting capabilities. Hisuian Samurott is another hazard setter that pairs well with Galarian Slowking, since it's able to soft check Pokemon that threaten Galarian Slowking like Weavile, Gholdengo, and Kingambit, whereas Galarian Slowking can take on Iron Valiant and Serperior for it while still retaining a threatening offensive presence thanks to its great coverage and solid offensive stats. Zamazenta is a great partner on bulky offense teams due to its favorable Kingambit matchup and ability to soft check many other physical attackers that threaten Galarian Slowking like Meowscarada, Ogerpon-W, and Weavile. IronPress sets can set up and sweep after Galarian Slowking has removed their checks and chipped the opposing team into KO range. Various other offensive Pokemon such as Primarina, Kingambit, Ogerpon-W, and Roaring Moon also greatly appreciate Galarian Slowking functioning as a defensive Pokemon with a notable offensive presence, allowing for more flexibility when teambuilding. Other bulky Regenerator Pokemon like Alomomola and Hydrapple can form Regenerator cores with Galarian Slowking, outlasting many offensive builds while covering each other's weaknesses. Alomomola can wall Fire- and Ground-types like Cinderace, Heatran, and Great Tusk, while Hydrapple is able to beat Water-types like Ogerpon-W, Hisuian Samurott, and Dondozo.</p>"

    "sets": {
      "Choice Band": {},
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Scizor fills a unique role on fast-paced offensive teams with its combination of solid defensive typing, strong priority, Knock Off, and Swords Dance. STAB- and Technician-boosted Bullet Punch offers some of the most consistent revenge killing in the tier, especially against physically frail or Steel-weak sweepers like Roaring Moon, Iron Valiant, and Kyurem. Swords Dance enables Scizor's other two main functions, allowing it to wallbreak early in the battle or clean a weakened team later on, with +2 Bullet Punch OHKOing many offensive Pokemon like Dragapult and Meowscarada. Close Combat is Scizor's strongest option against neutral targets, most notably Skarmory and Corviknight, which are always 2HKOed by +2 Close Combat after Stealth Rock damage. Unboosted Close Combat also OHKOes Kingambit and Hisuian Samurott, which resist both of Scizor's other attacking moves. Knock Off primarily allows Scizor to threaten Gholdengo, OHKOing offensive variants before a Swords Dance and OHKOing all Gholdengo lacking Colbur Berry at +2. The combination of Knock Off and Swords Dance also makes Scizor efficient at removing items from bulky defensive Pokemon like Dondozo and Alomomola because many of the tier's Knock Off absorbers like Clefable and Gliscor cannot sustain taking boosted attacks. The EVs aim to maximize Scizor's damage output while outspeeding Adamant Kingambit, Ursaluna, and most defensive variants of Heatran. Tera Fire is the preferred choice for most teams, inverting Scizor's one weakness and providing Scizor with a burn immunity, flipping the matchup against Pokemon like Moltres, Cinderace, Dragapult, and Darkrai. Tera Steel and Tera Fighting are more niche but provide relevant benefits for some teams. Tera Steel aids in revenge killing and cleaning, allowing Scizor to OHKO Pokemon like Kyurem unboosted with Bullet Punch and to OHKO Iron Moth at +2 after Stealth Rock. Tera Fighting gives Scizor much higher immediate damage, notably OHKOing Ogerpon-W unboosted and having a chance to OHKO Alomomola at +2 with Close Combat.</p> <p>Scizor fits best on hyper offense structures. It both benefits greatly from entry hazards and improves their efficacy with its powerful Knock Off, so it should generally be on teams with a hazard-setting lead like Glimmora, Landorus-T, Deoxys-S, or even Ribombee for Sticky Web's speed control. It makes a good offensive pairing with anything that forces in Fairy-types like Roaring Moon and Zamazenta, as Scizor can then use the Fairy-type as a setup opportunity. Kingambit is one of Scizor's best partners for a myriad of reasons; the dual-priority combination of Bullet Punch and Sucker Punch greatly threatens opposing offense, while Scizor's boosted Knock Off and Kingambit's Supreme Overlord-boosted attacks can overwhelm defensive teams. Scizor is a deterrent to Encore Iron Valiant, a common roadblock for Kingambit, while Kingambit can force in and chip Great Tusk and Zamazenta for Scizor to clean up late-game. Kingambit's ability to force in Zamazenta early also makes Zamazenta waste Dauntless Shield. Scizor struggles most against bulky Pokemon that can take Bullet Punches and deal heavy damage in return. Some common examples are Gouging Fire and Raging Bolt, which can also outspeed Scizor. The best teammates to help against these Pokemon are choices like Great Tusk and the aforementioned Roaring Moon that can immediately threaten Scizor's answers and potentially switch in on a good prediction or come in after Scizor is sacrificed to keep up the offensive pressure. Alomomola and Dondozo are very hard for Scizor to wear down without heavy entry hazard support, so Ogerpon-W is a great teammate, as it can come in on and threaten both while benefitting from the Knock Off support that Scizor provides. Zamazenta is similarly hard to wear down for Scizor and can use it as a setup opportunity, so choices like Encore Iron Valiant and Gholdengo can help to alleviate that issue. In summary, Scizor is primary used to provide heavy pressure against key threats to hyper offense like Iron Valiant, Enamorus, Kyurem, and Roaring Moon, at the cost of requiring considerable support against physically bulky attackers like Gouging Fire, Raging Bolt, and Zamazenta.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Skarmory is commonly used as an anti-setup Pokemon, having great bulk and a strong defensive typing that lets it check common offensive physical threats such as Kingambit, Great Tusk, Iron Boulder, and Zamazenta. Skarmory's immense physical bulk allows it to tank hits from the aforementioned Pokemon and punish them with Rocky Helmet chip damage, making it a great sponge on balanced structures. Skarmory is able to set up Iron Defense on physical attackers, increasing its Defense exponentially and massively boosting the power of Body Press while denying any setup opportunities. With enough Defense boosts, Skarmory can turn into a deadly late-game win condition with IronPress, only stopped by Ghost-types. Rocky Helmet makes it impossible for even fully Attack-boosted Pokemon to match its Defense boosts, as Skarmory's access to Roost grants it longevity, letting it outlive almost every physical setup Pokemon in the long term. Iron Defense Skarmory also has access to Spikes and Stealth Rock, making it more proactive against Pokemon such as Gliscor and Ting-Lu that may use it as an opportunity to set up entry hazards. Tera Dragon gives Skarmory a great resistance to Fire, which lets it check Pokemon such as Cinderace; it also eases the matchup against Ogerpon-W. Tera Fighting gives Skarmory extra insurance against Kingambit thanks to its Kowtow Cleave resistance and is especially useful for teams that are potentially weak to Jolly Kingambit late-game. Skarmory is EVed to outspeed Adamant Kingambit, with the remaining EVs allocated to HP and Defense.</p> <p>Iron Defense Skarmory is outstanding on balance teams that struggle against setup Pokemon that take advantage of the team's passivity, synergizing with Pokemon like Gliscor, Ting-Lu, and Clefable, as they can set up entry hazards to pressure foes as well as remove opposing Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off. It also pairs well with Toxapex and Galarian Slowking, which can sponge special moves that Skarmory is unable to take, and they also check dangerous threats such as Iron Moth and Cinderace. These Pokemon are often fodder for opposing Swords Dance Kingambit or Bulk Up Great Tusk; however, Skarmory handles them with ease. Skarmory is also great against Pokemon such as Iron Defense Zamazenta and Rillaboom thanks to its solid typing and immense bulk. Chip damage from Rocky Helmet disincentivizes the aforementioned Pokemon from using physical moves, and Skarmory outlives them eventually thanks to its longevity and recovery capabilities with Roost. Despite Skarmory's great physical bulk, it is vulnerable to special attackers and Ghost-types that may take advantage of it, such as Iron Moth, Gholdengo, and Dragapult. Ting-Lu and Galarian Slowking are great for tanking special attackers' hits, the former being a great Ghost-type check. Heavy-Duty Boots Kingambit is also a good choice alongside Skarmory, as it can find opportunities to set up against Ghost-types while being a reliable sponge, as well as having strong priority moves against the special attackers that Skarmory would otherwise struggle against. In return, Skarmory can set Spikes for Kingambit and act as a reliable wall to some of Kingambit's checks, particularly Bulk Up Great Tusk and Iron Defense Zamazenta. Due to its lack of pivoting capabilities unlike Corviknight, Skarmory also appreciates Pokemon that can tank hits and pivot around, such as Rotom-W, U-turn Gliscor, and Meowscarada.</p>"

Seismic Toss is Blissey's go-to damaging move, but it can opt for Flamethrower to hit Gholdengo, as well as threaten a rare burn against physical attackers looking to switch into Blissey. Another option is Shadow Ball, which allows Blissey to hit both Gholdengo and Dragapult, as well as any Tera Ghost users looking to set up on Blissey. Calm Mind gives Blissey a way to check dangerous setup sweepers like Darkrai and Raging Bolt more reliably, able to match their Special Attack boosts with its own Special Defense boosts, as well as boosting Flamethrower. Alternatively, Protect allows Blissey to safely absorb Future Sight, scout Choice-locked attackers, stall out weather turns, and burn the PP of powerful moves like Draco Meteor and Make It Rain. Stealth Rock gives Blissey another way to wear down the opposing team, as its high Special bulk allows Blissey to set rocks multiple times over the course of a game. Alternatively, Blissey can also choose Flamethrower for the same reasons listed above, not having to drop Seismic Toss this time, or run Heal Bell, allowing Blissey to take a cleric role for the team. With such high HP, Blissey chooses to invest EVs in Defense and Special Defense instead, still bolstering its absurd special bulk while lessening the damage from physical moves that would otherwise chip it down. Tera Dark gives Blissey a crucial Psychic immunity, allowing it to ignore Psyshock, Stored Power, Psychic Noise, and Future Sight from the likes of Hatterene, Latias, Primarina, and Gholdengo. Tera Water offers Blissey a resistance to Water, Fire, and Steel, useful for checking threats like Walking Wake and Heatran. Last but not least, Tera Fairy turns Blissey's Fighting weakness into a resistance, as well as an immunity to Dragon and a resistance to Dark, helping Blissey's matchup against Dragon Darts Dragapult.</p> <p>Blissey’s titanic bulk makes it mandatory on stall teams, which can tolerate its passive nature. Dondozo pairs exceptionally well with Blissey, forming an excellent stalwart defensive core that can wall the vast majority of threats in the metagame. Blissey also enjoys teammates like Alomomola, Gliscor, and Clefable, which can switch into physical threats like Great Tusk and Zamazenta that Blissey cannot wall, as well as absorb Knock Off that would otherwise cripple Blissey, while Blissey can handle special attackers like Raging Bolt and Iron Moth that would threaten Blissey's teammates. Another excellent partner is Clodsire, which can check boosted special threats like Serperior and Gholdengo that Blissey struggles to keep up with, while Blissey can wall Pokemon like Walking Wake and Primarina that can hit Clodsire with powerful super effective moves, as well as absorbing status that might otherwise cripple Clodsire. Furthermore, either Blissey or Clodsire can run Stealth Rock, freeing up the other to run moves like Heal Bell or Flamethrower for Blissey, or Amnesia for Clodsire. Corviknight also works well with Blissey, serving as a Knock Off absorber, entry hazard remover, and a check against dangerous physical threats like Kingambit and Zamazenta.</p>"

Its perfectly-accurate STAB Hurricane threatens Zamazenta, Great Tusk, and Grass-types like Rillaboom and Ogerpon-W— which are generally huge threats to rain teams—while dealing great neutral damage to Water-resistant targets like Hisuian Samurott and Dragapult. Surf threatens a number of common Stealth Rock setters such as Gliscor and Landorus-T with OHKOs in rain, while Knock Off cripples foes like Galarian Slowking and Alomomola, making them easier for Pelipper's teammates to break through. A Speed-reducing nature in conjunction with 0 Speed IVs gives Pelipper its slowest possible U-turn, allowing it to safely bring in teammates to make use of its rain. It also lets Pelipper underspeed uninvested Tyranitar and the niche Hippowdon, allowing its rain to override their sand in the lead matchup. A physically defensive EV spread lets Pelipper easily handle physical threats like Hisuian Samurott and Zamazenta, running enough Special Defense EVs to guarantee take on Enamorus's Moonblast after Stealth Rock. On the other hand, a specially defensive spread can be used to take less damage from special attackers that would otherwise take advantage of Pelipper's poor Special Defense, such as Gholdengo and Enamorus, as well as avoiding an OHKO from Choice Specs Dragapult's Draco Meteor, while running enough Defense EVs to survive two Hisuian Samurott's Ceaseless Edge from full. Though Pelipper is rarely Terastallized, Tera Ground can be used to remove its 4x weakness to Electric-type moves from Raging Bolt and Zapdos and safely pivot out of them.</p> <p>Pelipper should be used exclusively on rain teams where it is commonly partnered with powerful wallbreakers like Barraskewda, which is greatly enabled by Swift Swim activation, and Raging Bolt, which benefits from Water-type Weather Ball to break through Ground-types. Due to Pelipper's weakness to Stealth Rock and that it can't afford to run Heavy-Duty Boots, it benefits greatly from Rapid Spin support from Iron Treads to allow it to repeatedly set rain. Because Damp Rock is needed to maximize the number of rain turns, Pelipper appreciates having a teammate that can switch into Knock Off, such as Kingambit, especially if its Air Balloon has been popped. Due to its 4x weakness to Electric-type moves, Pelipper enjoys Ground-type teammates like Iron Treads that can easily switch into the likes of Raging Bolt. Pokemon like Air Balloon Kingambit that can help against Kyurem are also appreciated, as Pelipper is unable to defensively check it and rain teams tend to struggle against it.</p>"

Rapid Spin and Stealth Rock grant Torkoal excellent role compression as both an entry hazard remover and setter that can threaten other common leads like Skarmory, Ribombee, and Iron Treads with Lava Plume while also being naturally slower than both Tyranitar and Pelipper, ensuring that sun is the weather that stays up in the lead matchup. Will-O-Wisp can cripple physical attackers like Great Tusk looking to scare Torkoal out, while Body Press can be run instead to improve Torkoal's matchup against Taunt Roaring Moon, Heatran, and Ting-Lu. A physically defensive EV spread with 12 Special Defense EVs lets Torkoal easily take hits from common threats like Zamazenta and Hawlucha while still living defensive Gholdengo's +2 Shadow Ball and two of Choice Specs Kyurem's Ice Beam. A specially defensive EV spread can instead help bolster Torkoal's middling Special Defense against the likes of Dragapult and Gholdengo, with 36 Defense EVs letting it survive +2 Weavile's Knock Off after Stealth Rock. Though Torkoal is rarely the choice to be Terastallized, Tera Flying can be used to remove its Ground-type weakness versus Pokemon like Landorus-T and Great Tusk, while Tera Water is an all-around solid defensive typing that greatly improves its matchups against rain teams and Pokemon like Iron Boulder and Heatran.</p> <p>Torkoal should only be used on sun teams, where wallbreakers like Gouging Fire and Walking Wake take great advantage of the sun to activate Protosynthesis and power up their Fire-type moves and Hydro Steam. Raging Bolt is also an appreciated addition to sun teams to threaten Water-types like Ogerpon-W and Dondozo, and Choice Band Roaring Moon is another fantastic option thanks to its ability to serve as an offensive pivot with U-turn, wallbreaker, and potential revenge killer if using Speed-boosting Protosynthesis. Hisuian Lilligant is also a strong late-game cleaner on sun teams, helping check Ground-types while significantly improving the often difficult matchup against Iron Boulder thanks to outspeeding it with Chlorophyll active, and Venusaur can also serve as a slower if slightly bulkier Chlorophyll sweeper. Because Torkoal's primary role is to set sun, it appreciates teammates like Kingambit and Eject Button Hatterene that can switch into Knock Off and allow it to keep its Heat Rock. Despite also serving as an entry hazard remover, Torkoal is weak to Stealth Rock and lacks any form of reliable recovery, so it benefits from secondary removal support from teammates like Great Tusk and Iron Treads. Hatterene is a great teammate that can serve as a tertiary form of hazard control with Magic Bounce, help keep its own threats healthy with Healing Wish, and check common Ground-types like Gliscor and Great Tusk with Calm Mind sets.</p>"

Recover is important because it provides Latias with some reliable recovery, and Substitute is an alternative that matches up better against bulkier and slower foes and those that rely on status moves, such as Alomomola and Gliscor, though both these move options lose the benefit of boosting Stored Power in exchange for their utility. 24 EVs in Speed along with a Timid nature allow it to outrun Choice Scarf Darkrai after an Agility boost. An alternative spread with maximum investment in HP and Speed should be used in sets without Agility to make the most out of Latias's more than serviceable Speed tier. Tera Poison is the way to go to avoid Toxic damage, turn opposing Gliscor into setup fodder, and only have a weakness to Psychic, which is a fairly uncommon attacking type. Tera Steel similarly allows Latias to bypass Toxic while adding some valuable immunities and resistances, negating efforts from Galarian Slowking and Primarina to stop it. Tera Fairy can be used along with Draining Kiss to boost its damage and subsequent healing and obtain a valuable Dragon immunity in the face of foes like Dragapult and Kyurem. Generally, the passive recovery granted by Leftovers make it its preferred item, but Weakness Policy is a great offensive alternative if one feels confident in Latias's defensive profile against its threats. Some alternative fringe options include Tera Electric, removing all weaknesses thanks to Levitate and providing an immunity to paralysis, which can be useful against Galarian Slowking and defensive variants of Gholdengo, and Mental Herb, allowing Latias to bypass Taunt from Landorus-T.</p> <p>Latias finds itself a niche pick in hyper offense teams; in particular, it can support teams by dealing with Unaware foes like Dondozo and Clodsire as a way to open through and act as a win condition. Latias's base typing makes it vulnerable to several metagame threats such as Gholdengo and Dragapult. Gholdengo can overwhelm it by either outdamaging it with a Nasty Plot-boosted Shadow Ball or crippling it with paralysis, sustaining its not very effective hits with Recover, and attacking back with Hex, while Dragapult outspeeds it before an Agility boost and threatens it with STAB moves or status. Kingambit makes for a great partner overall, checking Dragapult and Gholdengo along with other Ghost- and Dark-type foes that Latias may be stopped by. Opposing Kingambit poses an existential threat to Latias, as without Aura Sphere, it fails to do much in return, and without spending your Tera on Latias, it leaves itself exposed to Sucker Punch and Kowtow Cleave and even Iron Head if it goes Tera Fairy. Iron Valiant can prove decisive in this matchup, as well as mixing well with the fast-paced plan a Latias team should have. Play Rough variants of Ogerpon-W can overpower Latias, so Roaring Moon can assist by KOing it back with an Attack Booster Energy Acrobatics. Furthermore, breaking through Ting-Lu can prove to be challenging, so a strong wallbreaking partner such as Ogerpon-W could overwhelm it in return. Hazard support is really appreciated overall to help Latias clean in the endgame against a worn-down team, so Glimmora and Hisuian Samurott make for excellent partners. Latias also is a perfect match for teams championed by dual screens Deoxys-S or Alolan Ninetales, allowing it to set up with minimal damage taken.</p>"

      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to its monstrous Speed, decent attacking stats, and amazing coverage, Deoxys-S can function as a great revenge killer and late-game cleaner. It outspeeds every unboosted Pokemon in OU and outspeeds plenty of boosted Pokemon as well, such as +1 Great Tusk and +1 Dragonite. Fighting-type coverage is required to hit Dark- and Steel-types that switch into Psycho Boost, like Kingambit, Ting-Lu, and Heatran. Superpower can be run to hit special walls like Blissey, but Focus Blast doesn't have any stat drops and also benefits from boosts from Nasty Plot. Knock Off removes items, helping it break down walls like Galarian Slowking and Ting-Lu by removing Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers. Shadow Ball can be used instead if it's running Nasty Plot and to avoid being walled by Hatterene. In its last move slot, it can run Ice Beam for even greater coverage, letting it destroy Dragonite, Gliscor, and Landorus-T. However, Psycho Boost hits the latter two hard anyway, so Nasty Plot can be ran instead to drastically increase its killing power if it’s running only special moves. For example, +2 Psycho Boost can OHKO Primarina without Assault Vest, +2 Focus Blast can OHKO specially defensive Heatran, and +2 Shadow Ball can OHKO Galarian Slowking, Hatterene, and Gholdengo. Finally, Taunt can be used as utility, denying hazards, setup, and keeping Deoxys-S free from status like Gliscor's Toxic and Clefable's Thunder Wave, and also stopping Galarian Slowking from gaining momentum with Chilly Reception. Other moves Deoxys-S can run include Expanding Force over Psycho Boost if it's used with Psychic Terrain and Stealth Rock or Spikes in its last slot to take advantage of switches. A Timid nature should be ran if using Nasty Plot, but a Naive nature should be used if running a mixed set. A Hasty nature is an alternative to better take special moves like Raging Bolt's Thunderclap, but it makes Deoxys-S weaker into common priority like Extreme Speed and Grassy Glide. Tera Fighting is its premier Tera type, giving it STAB on its Fighting-type coverage, letting it hit Psycho Boost switch-ins harder. It guarantees that Superpower will 2HKO Heatran and Iron Treads and lets +2 Focus Blast OHKO Ting-Lu. It also has defensive utility, like giving it a resistance to Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Tera Ghost can be useful on Shadow Ball sets to break past its Psychic-type switch-ins, letting it get a 2HKO on Galarian Slowking and Latias. It also gives Deoxys-S an immunity to Dragonite's Extreme Speed. Finally, Tera Psychic further boosts its Psycho Boosts, which lets it guarantee an OHKO into Walking Wake and Ogerpon-W. Life Orb boosts its damage output, but Expert Belt can be used instead to avoid recoil damage. However, missing out on Life Orb can cost Deoxys-S some KOs like missing a 2HKO on Clefable with Psycho Boost and losing the ability to do substantial damage to Corviknight.</p> <p>Deoxys-S is best on hyper offense and bulky offense teams. Offensive teammates such as Roaring Moon and Darkrai like the holes Deoxys-S pokes into opposing teams. It can damage walls like Ting-Lu, Blissey, and Galarian Slowking for these teammates or check other offensive Pokemon that outspeed them like Zamazenta and Dragapult. Its Fighting-type coverage takes care of Kingambit, Ting-Lu, and Heatran, removing checks for other teammates like its own Kingambit and Dragapult. Similarly, its Ghost- or Dark-type coverage lets it take out Hatterene and Gholdengo, opening up opportunities for teammates like Iron Valiant and Iron Boulder to clean up late-game. Thanks to its perfect coverage, it is able to deal decent damage to any opponent, further opening holes for its teammates. This includes Pokemon like Dondozo, Roaring Moon, and Corviknight. Offensive teammates also appreciate its fast Knock Off removing items like Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers from walls like Galarian Slowking and Ting-Lu. Entry hazard support from teammates like Hisuian Samurott, Ting-Lu, and Glimmora help with breaking as well. Similarly, if it runs Taunt, teammates such as Iron Moth like its fast Taunt denying hazards, stopping setup from opponents, and limiting recovery. While Deoxys-S has great coverage, its base 95 attacking stats are relatively low, and Psycho Boost lowering its Special Attack is less than ideal. As such, it can struggle to break past certain walls it can't hit super effectively like Corviknight and Assault Vest Primarina. Raging Bolt can freely switch into Corviknight and set up free Calm Minds as it switches out. Despite its massive natural Speed stat, Deoxys-S is still outsped by a lot of prominent boosted Pokemon like +1 Roaring Moon, +1 Iron Boulder, +1 Walking Wake, and Barraskewda in rain. These can be covered by carrying offensive checks to these mons like Kingambit, Air Balloon Gholdengo, and Ogerpon-W. Deoxys-S is also horribly weak to priority. It doesn't have many ways to work around Sucker Punch, and other priority like Grassy Glide and Extreme Speed hit it hard. A way around this is having teammates that can easily take common priority like Kingambit, Great Tusk, or Dragonite. Additionally, dual screen setters, like Alolan Ninetales, can help against priority and assist Deoxys-S in setting up Nasty Plots. Psychic Terrain from Indeedee is another option due to it blocking priority, and it also boosts Deoxys-S’s Psychic-type STAB moves.</p>"

      "Heavy-Duty Boots Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>This Deoxys-S set uses Heavy-Duty Boots for more longevity, which makes it a great anti-offense tool. Knock Off allows Deoxys-S to punish pivots like Galarian Slowking and Corviknight and threatens defensive Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Moltres by removing their items. Superpower lets it threaten dangerous Dark-types like Roaring Moon, Weavile, and Darkrai as well as other Pokemon such as Blissey. Ice Beam makes quick work of both Gliscor and Landorus-T, preventing them from setting entry hazards or pivoting out. The EV spread allows Deoxys-S to outspeed Speed Booster Energy Great Tusk. Tera Fighting allows Deoxys-S to survive a Sucker Punch from Kingambit and dispatch it on the spot with Superpower, and getting a chance to 2HKO Ting-Lu with Superpower can also come in handy.</p> <p>This set fits well on bulky offense and balance teams, as it provides the necessary speed control for teams, forcing out strong yet frail sweepers with its coverage as well as helping soften more defensive teams via Knock Off. This set struggles with Deoxys-S's lack of firepower combined with its frailty, making it hard to win games on its own. For these reasons, entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu, Skarmory, Hisuian Samurott, and Gliscor are great partners because they make Deoxys-S's ability to remove items much more dangerous against Pokemon with Leftovers or Heavy-Duty Boots like Ting-Lu, Galarian Slowking, and Moltres. Wallbreakers like Gholdengo, Ogerpon-W, Weavile, and Kingambit appreciate Deoxys-S's efforts to soften up and cripple Pokemon with Knock Off, allowing them to break through defensive teams more easily. Slow bulky pivots like Galarian Slowking and Corviknight can tank hits and bring Deoxys-S safely onto the field. Corviknight also helps defensively by checking Dark-types like Kingambit and Roaring Moon, giving Deoxys-S another layer of security. Alomomola provides momentum via Flip Turn and Wish support to keep Deoxys-S healthy. In return, Deoxys-S threatens Alomomola's greatest counter, Ogerpon-W, with STAB Psycho Boost. Skeledirge makes for an interesting partner, as it switches into common priority like Rillaboom's Grassy Glide and Dragonite's Extreme Speed, which it can then use as an opportunity to cripple them with Will-O-Wisp or start a snowball effect with Torch Song. Zamazenta is another great check to the aforementioned Dark-types, protecting Deoxys-S and using early-game chip damage to brute force its way to victory with Body Press. Deoxys-S and Zamazenta can work in tandem to pressure Galarian Slowking with the combination of Knock Off and Crunch, respectively.</p>"
      },
      "Hazard Lead": {
        "description": "<p>With its unmatched Speed stat, access to both Spikes and Stealth Rock, and ability to shut down opposing leads with Taunt, Deoxys-S is a premier entry hazard-setting lead for hyper offense teams in the OU metagame. Taunt is its greatest virtue, allowing it to prevent leads like Glimmora and Ting-Lu from setting their own hazards. This also serves to deny dual screens from opposing Deoxys-S and Alolan Ninetales, stop setup sweepers like Raging Bolt and Kingambit from using it as setup fodder, and prevent Cinderace from using Court Change on its hazards. Deoxys-S's last moveslot is more flexible; Psycho Boost gives Deoxys-S a high power STAB option to reliably deal damage, notably improving the matchup against lead Glimmora by preventing it from using Mortal Spin against Deoxys-S for free while also threatening to OHKO Great Tusk. Alternatively, Skill Swap is an option that allows for Deoxys-S to get up entry hazards against Hatterene by removing its Magic Bounce while also having the potential to remove Gliscor's Poison Heal and Serperior's Contrary to give a partner free turns to set up after Deoxys-S goes down, particularly in conjunction with Taunt to deny their Toxic and Glare respectively. Focus Sash is Deoxys-S's best item choice, potentially allowing it to set up multiple layers of hazards while also giving it insurance to take a hit and safely use Taunt on an opposing lead, but Mental Herb can instead be considered to block Taunt from opposing Deoxys-S and win the lead matchup. An EV spread maximizing Speed with a Timid nature is optimal for the tie with opposing Deoxys-S, while maximum Special Attack is selected to power up a set using Psycho Boost; for Skill Swap Deoxys-S, maximum HP is used instead. Tera Ghost is optimal on Deoxys-S for its ability to block Rapid Spin from Iron Treads, Torkoal, and Excadrill, while Tera Steel is a more niche option that grants it an immunity to Glimmora's Mortal Spin.</p> <p>Deoxys-S is an excellent fit on hyper offense teams that appreciate both entry hazards being set on the opponent's side of the field and hazards being denied in return by Taunt. This makes setup sweepers like Raging Bolt and Kingambit great pairings, as hazards can be used to wear down their checks like Ting-Lu and Great Tusk; these Pokemon themselves also enjoy hazards being kept off of their side of the field, with the latter two in particular appreciating the freedom to use a boosting item or Leftovers. Another offensive threat that enjoys hazards being able to wear down switch-ins is Dragon Dance Roaring Moon, itself able to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from targets like Dondozo with Knock Off to take full advantage of Deoxys-S's hazards. Many other offensive sweepers benefit greatly from hazard support from Deoxys-S, with Darkrai and Iron Valiant being fantastic partners that take advantage of checks like Ting-Lu, Heatran, and Primarina being forced to take hazard damage. Deoxys-S's strongest partner in this regard though is Gholdengo, which crucially blocks Rapid Spin from the likes of Great Tusk and Iron Treads along with Defog from Corviknight to ensure that Deoxys-S's hazards remain on the field for the rest of the game even after Deoxys-S goes down. Gholdengo additionally benefits from hazard support itself, as both Ting-Lu and Kingambit taking hazards upon switching into it can assist it greatly with breaking through a team. Unfortunately, despite Deoxys-S possessing the highest unboosted Speed in the tier, it does have some less than positive lead matchups; Booster Energy Iron Treads is able to outrun Deoxys-S and set up Stealth Rock against it while being able to remove Deoxys-S's hazards with Rapid Spin unless it chooses to Tera Ghost, and Hisuian Samurott can set Spikes with Ceaseless Edge regardless of Taunt before potentially picking Deoxys-S off with Aqua Jet after bringing it down to its Focus Sash. Forms of hazard removal that are still able to fit well onto a hyper offensive team are therefore appreciated, with Bulk Up Great Tusk able to provide excellent role compression as both a sweeper and a hazard remover with Rapid Spin. Strong priority users like Rillaboom and Dragonite can also choose to lead off and prevent Deoxys-S from being able to get up a second layer of hazards with their priority attacks; Booster Energy Iron Boulder can use Swords Dance on Deoxys-S before it can use Taunt without fearing a Psycho Boost; and specially defensive Pelipper is able to safely use U-turn on Deoxys-S to break its Focus Sash, bring in a Swift Swim user like Barraskewda, and deny more than one layer of hazards. Hence, offensive checks to these Pokemon such as Rillaboom and Dragonite themselves, Great Tusk, and Kingambit can help to patch up those matchups, with the latter three able to not only force out these threats but take advantage of them with their own setup options.</p>"
      },
      "Dual Screens": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to its unparalleled Speed tier and access to an array of solid utility options, Deoxys-S is one of the best dual screens setters in OU. Taunt is key in preventing Pokemon like Glimmora, Skarmory, Ting-Lu, and Landorus-T from laying entry hazards, setup threats such as Swords Dance Ogerpon-W from boosting, and Cinderace from using Court Change. Psycho Boost lets Deoxys-S have some sort of offensive presence; it can obliterate lead Glimmora while overwhelming neutral targets like Dondozo and physically defensive Skeledirge. Deoxys-S generally should not Terastallize, as being unable to Terastallize a wallbreaker later in the match could be game ending. However, in a pinch, Tera Steel can let it more easily set dual screens against priority users like Weavile, Dragonite, and Rillaboom.</p> <p>Deoxys-S is a fixture on dual screens hyper offense teams thanks to its absolutely blazing Speed that surpasses every unboosted Pokemon in the tier, letting it ensure at least one of Reflect or Light Screen go up. Setup sweepers like Roaring Moon, Iron Valiant, and Serperior are amazing at making use of Deoxys-S's screens support, taking a hit from Deoxys-S's potential revenge killers such as Kingambit and Cinderace with it and being able to strike back strong. Cleaners such as Kingambit, Dragonite, and Choice Scarf Enamorus are similarly potent behind dual screens. Due to Ceaseless Edge, Hisuian Samurott's Spikes cannot be denied by Deoxys-S, so Pokemon that can take advantage of Hisuian Samurott such as Iron Valiant and Enamorus are good teammates. Entry hazard control options like Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and Hatterene also make for good partners in the event that Deoxys-S is unable to prevent hazards being set. Great Tusk and Hatterene in particular can double as potent bulky setup sweepers with Bulk Up and Calm Mind, respectively. Other bulky setup Pokemon like Latias and Iron Crown benefit similarly from screens.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Weavile is an excellent wallbreaker thanks to its high Speed and Attack and high-Base Power moves, including a Knock Off that Skarmory, Gliscor, and Clefable cannot safely absorb. Weavile also provides excellent speed control for teams, outspeeding the entire unboosted metagame besides Darkrai, Zamazenta, Dragapult, and Deoxys-S while being able to slot in Ice Shard to pick off +1 Roaring Moon, Dragapult, and Choice Scarf Enamorus. Swords Dance allows Weavile to OHKO bulky Pokemon like defensive Great Tusk and Ting-Lu at +2 with Triple Axel and OHKO Enamorus and Dragapult after Stealth Rock with Ice Shard. Low Kick can be slotted over Swords Dance to OHKO opposing Weavile, Hisuian Samurott, and Kingambit, but dropping Swords Dance limits Weavile's power and leaves it always walled by Skarmory and Clefable. Tera Ice boosts Triple Axel and Ice Shard to increase its wallbreaking and revenge killing potential, with +2 Tera Ice Triple Axel OHKOing Clefable and most Skarmory variants after Stealth Rock damage and +2 Tera Ice Ice Shard OHKOing Dragonite. Tera Dark can be ran to boost Knock Off, with Weavile now having significant odds of OHKOing specially defensive Skeledirge and specially defensive Heatran as well as 2HKOing Alomomola at +2 while still stomaching Kingambit's Sucker Punch.</p> <p>Weavile's excellent wallbreaking capabilities and capability to fit on offense, balance, and semi-stall teams give it great synergy with a wide variety of Pokemon. Spikers are the best Pokemon to pair with Weavile because Weavile is excellent at using Knock Off to remove Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers. On slower teams, Spikers that benefit from Weavile include Gliscor, Skarmory and Ting-Lu, while on faster teams, Weavile supports Hisuian Samurott and Deoxys-S. Stealth Rock is less effective against most Weavile answers other than Skarmory and Corviknight, but they still synergize with Weavile's Knock Off. Stealth Rock setters on offensive teams include Glimmora and Landorus-T, while bulkier teams can make use of Great Tusk, Gliscor, and Clefable. Weavile also benefits other physical attackers that appreciate Weavile using Knock Off on Pokemon like Skarmory, Dondozo, Corviknight, and Alomomola. Kingambit is the biggest beneficiary of Weavile's Knock Off, but other physical attackers like Hisuian Samurott and Swords Dance Iron Valiant can also take advantage of its Knock Off to break through Pokemon like Dondozo and prevent chip damage from Skarmory's Rocky Helmet. Special attackers like Raging Bolt and Dragapult can draw in special walls like Ting-Lu, Galarian Slowking, and Clodsire for Weavile to come in on for opportunities to use Knock Off; Dragapult in particular can use U-turn to pivot to Weavile. Weavile struggles with faster Pokemon that can't be threatened with Ice Shard, which includes boosted Iron Valiant, Zamazenta, and boosted Iron Boulder. On slower teams, Pokemon that can wall these faster foes are appreciated like Clodsire and Galarian Slowking for Iron Valiant, while Dondozo and Skarmory are best for Iron Boulder and Zamazenta. On faster teams, Gholdengo and priority users like Raging Bolt can check them. Galarian Slowking in particular is excellent, as Weavile appreciates support from Chilly Reception giving it entry on Pokemon like Gholdengo and Ting-Lu, while Future Sight prevents switch-ins like Zamazenta, Dondozo and Skarmory from coming in. Dondozo, Zamazenta and Skarmory can counter Weavile, but Dragapult and Gholdengo can swap into their attacks and force progress; Dragapult threatens heavy damage or burn, while Gholdengo can use these Pokemon to boost with Nasty Plot.</p>"

  "Gliscor": {
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Gliscor can make a lot of easy progress throughout the game thanks to its great bulk, being able to use Swords Dance in front of opposing Gliscor and other passive Pokemon such as Clefable, Clodsire, and Toxapex to become an offensive threat. Gliscor being permanently affected by poison allows it to use Facade consistently, which breaks Pokemon such as Ogerpon-W, Hawlucha, and Dragonite. Swords Dance Gliscor can threaten common Knock Off absorbers like Clefable, particularly on Heavy-Duty Boots spam teams, so it can effectively use Knock Off instead against these teams to punish different foes, especially entry hazard-weak Pokemon such as Zapdos and Enamorus. Ice Fang is another option that can be run over Knock Off to shut down opposing Swords Dance Gliscor, which may give the team trouble, and hits Dragonite hard while still targeting Rillaboom. Tera Water flips Gliscor's matchup against Ice- and Water-types such as Weavile and Barraskewda defensively; however, it becomes a worse check to Pokemon such as Rillaboom. Tera Normal should always be run alongside Facade to muscle past physically bulky threats like Moltres, Zapdos, and Alomomola after a Swords Dance. Gliscor also greatly appreciates Tera Normal's immunity to Ghost-type attacks, most notably Hex from Dragapult and Gholdengo looking to turn Gliscor's Poison Heal into a liability. For teams that are not as strong defensively into Grass-types, Tera Dragon is recommended, as it covers for both Water and Grass, and most notably, it shuts down Ogerpon-W and gains a better matchup versus Serperior and other potent offensive threats that would have been able to beat Gliscor even with Tera Water. 16 Special Defense EVs allow Gliscor to survive both a Choice Specs Enamorus's Moonblast and Life Orb Deoxys-S's Psycho Boost from full health, or it can be given more special bulk to better handle common offensive threats like Iron Valiant, Dragapult, and Iron Moth, which may chunk it heavily and affect its time on field otherwise. The 36 Defense EVs on the specially bulky EV spread allow Gliscor to comfortably survive Ogerpon-W's Ivy Cudgel from full health.</p> <p>Swords Dance Gliscor best fits on teams that need to break balance structures, most prominently teams that utilize multiple Heavy-Duty Boots users. Gliscor enjoys being a part of Spikes-stacking teams that need guaranteed progress against opposing Heavy-Duty Boots spam teams, which Spikes-stacking teams usually lose to. As a result, Ting-Lu and Skarmory are great teammates, as they can set up entry hazards and directly complement Gliscor defensively. Gholdengo also pairs well, preventing Defog and hindering the removal of hazards. However, Gliscor's lack of Toxic or hazards makes it exert less pressure long-term, prevents it from placing opposing Pokemon on a timer such as Ting-Lu and Great Tusk, and means it cannot punish any switch-ins to it with a Toxic. Teammates such as Weavile and Choice Specs Dragapult help Gliscor's lack of pressure with great upfront damage. Swords Dance Gliscor is also unable to deal with the common Iron Defense Skarmory on balance teams or muscle through common defensive walls such as Dondozo and Corviknight; however, access to Knock Off allows it remove their items at the very least, which could be helpful in the long run for Gliscor's teammates. Teammates such as, Cinderace and Rotom-W are great with Swords Dance Gliscor, as they can beat the fatter Pokemon that Gliscor is unable to muscle through, such as the aforementioned Skarmory, Ting-Lu, and Corviknight. Gholdengo and Ogerpon-W are also good options, as they are able to turn threats such as Skarmory and Dondozo into setup fodder.</p>"
      },
      "Spikes": {
        "description": "<p>Gliscor is a premier Spikes user. The combination of Poison Heal and Protect allows it to outlast common entry hazard removal options such as Great Tusk and Cinderace, setting it apart from its peers. Gliscor can survive some of the strongest neutral attacks in the tier with ease, including Life Orb Darkrai's Dark Pulse, Choice Specs Dragapult's Shadow Ball, and Kingambit's Kowtow Cleave. Its immunity to status conditions helps it against more defensively oriented teams, allowing it to be unfazed by Toxic from opposing Gliscor, Galarian Slowking, and Clodsire or by Will-O-Wisp from Cinderace and Skeledirge. Protect is not just useful for giving Gliscor a free turn of recovery; it is also useful for scouting the moves of Choice-locked Pokemon that are able to break it, like Walking Wake. Toxic is used to whittle away at the foe’s health, as the combination of Toxic and Protect allows the poison damage to worsen while Gliscor heals itself in the process. Gliscor spreads status exceptionally well because most Pokemon immune to Toxic like Clodsire and Gholdengo are weak to Earthquake. Toxic is not always required though, as Knock Off can be substituted over it to remove foes' Heavy-Duty Boots, allowing teams that rely on hazard stacking to make progress, especially if the team lacks another Knock Off user or have a different Toxic user. On stall teams, Poison Jab can be run instead to allow Gliscor to pressure Hatterene and Taunt Tera Flying Roaring Moon, which otherwise have extremely favorable matchups against the team. A specially defensive EV spread with a Careful nature checks Pokemon like Heatran, Raging Bolt, and Gholdengo, retaining enough physical bulk to live Ogerpon-W's unboosted Ivy Cudgel from full. A physically defensive EV spread with an Impish nature can be run instead to let Gliscor check Pokemon like Great Tusk lacking Ice Spinner, Dragonite, Iron Boulder, and Roaring Moon, and the Special Defense EVs provide enough special bulk to survive +1 Enamorus's Moonblast and +1 Raging Bolt's Dragon Pulse from full. Both sets run 244 HP EVs to maximize the amount of health Gliscor recovers from Poison Heal. Tera Water lets Gliscor flip bad matchups against Water-types like Walking Wake and Hisuian Samurott as well as Ice-types like Weavile while being a great defensive typing in general. Tera Ghost prevents Rapid Spin users like Great Tusk and Iron Treads from removing its Spikes and grants an immunity to Facade from Ursaluna, which is otherwise very problematic for the bulky teams that Gliscor fits in, as well as Body Press from Zamazenta. However, these are best reserved as a last resort, since Gliscor immensely appreciates its base typing because of its Stealth Rock neutrality and Spikes immunity. Moreover, Gliscor's teammates will generally get more mileage from Tera, so using it on Gliscor is not worth it most of the time.</p> <p>Gliscor functions best on entry hazard stacking balance teams, since its role compression provides flexibility in what Pokemon and sets these structures can run; it is also excellent on stall teams due to its longevity and excellent defensive profile. Gliscor’s role as a Spikes setter and Toxic user gives its team a much easier time breaking down opposing defensive balances and pivoting cores, punishing switches and poisoning foes that decide to stay in. Gliscor works in conjunction with its offensive partners by forcing switches while also soaking up incoming attacks from powerful offensive threats, giving it and its teammates ample opportunities to force progress. With these traits, Gholdengo makes an amazing teammate for Gliscor, since after Gliscor sets up Spikes, Gholdengo blocks all removal options aside from Court Change Cinderace, which Gliscor can beat one-on-one. Galarian Slowking is another great teammate, being able to sponge hits from strong special attackers such as Walking Wake, Serperior, and Enamorus, many of which threaten Gliscor out. In return, Gliscor walls physical Ground-type attackers that easily dispose of Galarian Slowking, like Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Landorus-T. Stealth Rock users such as Ting-Lu and Clefable pair very well with Gliscor, and stacking hazards is a very effective way at making progress. Knock Off users such as the aforementioned Clefable, as well as Meowscarada and Weavile, work well with Gliscor, since they allow it to run Toxic to punish bulkier Pokemon, and they are able to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon that do not come in on Gliscor so that its hazards can chip more effectively throughout the game. Late-game cleaners such as Dragapult, Meowscarada, and Kingambit all work well with Gliscor too, as they appreciate their checks having to constantly switch and get chipped by Spikes early- and mid-game, putting them into KO range late-game. Because Gliscor is so excellent on stall teams, teammates like Dondozo, Clodsire, and Blissey greatly appreciate Gliscor's ability to force progress with Spikes and the niche Poison Jab, especially against threats to stall like Calm Mind Hatterene and Taunt Roaring Moon. In return, Dondozo can sponge powerful Ice-type attacks from Meowscarada and Weavile while keeping powerful physical attackers like Kingambit at bay, while Clodsire and Blissey can collectively wall the vast majority of special attackers and take some pressure off Gliscor as a result.</p>"

      "Defensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>Rotom-W is a defensive pivot that takes advantage of its good defensive stats, typing, and ability. Volt Switch allows Rotom-W to pivot out, letting its frailer offensive teammates in without fear of taking a substantial amount of damage. Hydro Pump synergizes well with Volt Switch, punishing Ground-types like Ting-Lu and Great Tusk. Pain Split serves as a semi-reliable recovery option that lets it more consistently check threats like Great Tusk, Gliscor, and Darkrai throughout the course of a game. It also uses defensive Pokemon like Galarian Slowking and Blissey as an opportunity to get back to full health due to the large differences in health. Will-O-Wisp is preferred with the physically defensive set in order to cripple physical threats like Kingambit, Weavile, and Dragonite, and Thunder Wave is used with the specially defensive spread to cripple fast special attackers like Darkrai, Dragapult, and Walking Wake. Leftovers is run to give Rotom-W additional passive recovery, but Rocky Helmet can also be used on physically defensive sets in order to punish contact attackers like Landorus-T, Cinderace, and Zamazenta. Both spreads run 44 Speed EVs to outspeed Jolly Kingambit. Tera Steel is used to gain a Toxic immunity, letting it completely wall Pokemon like Galarian Slowking, Gliscor, Dragonite, and Clodsire, with the added perks of resisting Freeze-Dry and therefore allowing it to check Kyurem. Tera Fairy grants Rotom-W resistances to Dark- and Fighting-type attacks, allowing it to more easily inflict status on and check Pokemon like Roaring Moon, Zamazenta, and Weavile.</p> <p>Rotom-W best fits on balance and bulky offense teams utilizing pivoting cores like Landorus-T on bulky offense and Galarian Slowking on balance to make progress. Rotom-W is able to threaten Gliscor and Corviknight for Landorus-T, and Landorus-T is able to alleviate the Raging Bolt matchup, as well as checking Zamazenta. Rotom-W helps Galarian Slowking by switching into Ground-types like Landorus-T and Great Tusk that Galarian Slowking hates facing, and Galarian Slowking is able to check threats such as Kyurem's special attacking variants, Ogerpon, and Serperior for it. Gliscor is able to set Spikes, which stacks up chip alongside Rotom-W's frequent pivoting, and Swords Dance variants greatly appreciate Rotom-W being able to take on Corviknight and Skarmory for it. Bulky Grass-types like Amoonguss and Sinistcha are excellent partners because they are able to take on Ogerpon-W, which can switch in on Hydro Pump and threaten Rotom-W with Power Whip or Encore. Rotom-W is able to return the favor by checking Weavile and Fire-types like Heatran and Moltres for them. Garganacl is another good partner for Rotom-W, as Rotom-W can threaten Ground-types like Great Tusk and Ting-Lu that Garganacl struggles against, while Garganacl can stack chip damage through Stealth Rock and Salt Cure, as well as checking threats like Dragapult and Kyurem. Ting-Lu fits with physically defensive Rotom-W on balance teams to check Ghost-types like Gholdengo and Dragapult, since Dragapult resists both of Rotom-W's STAB moves and can threaten it back with Choice Specs-boosted Draco Meteor or Shadow Ball, while Gholdengo has enough natural special bulk to avoid the 2HKO from Hydro Pump and is immune to Rotom-W's status moves. Dragapult and Gholdengo themselves work well with Rotom-W because it can spread status effectively for both Pokemon to fire off boosted Hex later, which is especially good since Rotom-W also cripples Dark-types like Kingambit and Darkrai. Tinkaton can also work well with Rotom-W as a hazard setter that can punish setup sweepers and check Kyurem without needing to use Terastallization on Rotom-W.</p>"

      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<p>Heatran is a fearsome wallbreaker capable of easily shutting down defensive teams, leveraging its defensive profile to find multiple opportunities to switch in and wreak havoc. Magma Storm is a powerful Fire-type STAB move that can trap Pokemon like Blissey and Toxapex. Earth Power allows Heatran to hit Fire-types that would otherwise resist Magma Storm such as Iron Moth, Skeledirge, and opposing Leftovers Heatran. Taunt completely shuts down recovery from defensive Pokemon that would otherwise withstand its offensive assault such as Galarian Slowking and Blissey, and it allows Heatran to beat each of these Pokemon 1-on-1 in tandem with Magma Storm. Stealth Rock can be considered in the last slot, as Heatran's consistency in forcing switches can give it a free turn to set up Stealth Rock; however, Will-O-Wisp can be used to hinder switch-ins such as Roaring Moon and Ting-Lu that would otherwise freely switch in against Heatran. A Timid nature lets Heatran outspeed and threaten Choice Band Rillaboom, in addition to quickly burning Adamant Dragonite with Will-O-Wisp, though a Modest nature could be considered to guarantee an OHKO on bulky Kingambit variants. Tera Grass flips Heatran's matchup against Water- and Ground-types such as Hisuian Samurott and Landorus-T and synergizes very well with Flash Fire; Tera Ghost grants Heatran a crucial Fighting immunity that can help against Zamazenta, in addition to blocking Rapid Spin from the likes of Great Tusk and Iron Treads. Leftovers provides Heatran with passive recovery and allows it to stick around over the course of the match; Air Balloon could also be used to provide Heatran with a temporary Ground immunity, letting it safely switch into Landorus-T and opposing Heatran.</p> <p>Heatran fits primarily on offense and bulky offense teams where it excels in ripping apart defensive cores for its teammates to exploit. Special sweepers such as Primarina and Raging Bolt greatly enjoy Heatran trapping and removing their checks, particularly Blissey. In return, Primarina discourages Ground-type switch-ins such as Landorus-T and Ting-Lu, while Raging Bolt can force out Water-types like Barraskewda and Hisuian Samurott. Rillaboom is another fantastic teammate for Heatran that not only provides it with extra passive recovery and more resistance against Earthquake but can form a formidable offensive core with it, with Rillaboom capable of handling Ground- and Water-types such as Great Tusk and Ogerpon-W and Heatran taking advantage of Rillaboom's switch-ins like Corviknight and Skeledirge, alongside setting Stealth Rock to spread chip damage for both itself and Rillaboom. Additionally, some of Rillaboom's teammates like Hawlucha and Hatterene appreciate Heatran removing their checks via Magma Storm, allowing them to more easily sweep late-game, while both Pokemon can force out Ground- and Fighting-types like Great Tusk and Zamazenta. Lastly, Heatran enjoys Rapid Spin support from Great Tusk removing entry hazards that cut into its longevity, and it also enjoys having a check to Dragonite. In exchange, Heatran can easily switch in on and threaten Pokemon such as Meowscarada, Weavile, and Calm Mind Iron Valiant that Great Tusk struggles against.</p>"
      },
      "Specially Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Specially defensive Heatran is a useful glue Pokemon that can stallbreak, set entry hazards, spread status, and check notable special attackers like Gholdengo, Hatterene, and Galarian Slowking. Earth Power is a much-needed coverage move to hit Pokemon like opposing Heatran, Toxapex, and Skeledirge super effectively. Taunt is used to shut down recovery attempts from walls like Toxapex, Clodsire, and Terastallized Skeledirge that are trapped by Magma Storm, prevent Galarian Slowking from using Chilly Reception to escape Magma Storm's trapping, and prevent setup from both slower hazard setters like Clefable and Ting-Lu and slower setup sweepers like Terastallized Kingambit and Primarina. Stealth Rock is an extremely good fit since Heatran has excellent special bulk and threatens forms of hazard removal like Defog Corviknight and prevents Rapid Spin Great Tusk from switching in with a hard-hitting Magma Storm, keeping entry hazards up in the process. It is also able to punish Hatterene from switching in to deflect Stealth Rock back with Magic Bounce since it is unable to hit Heatran back for any notable damage. Will-O-Wisp can be used as a way to better check physical threats that enjoy switching in like Roaring Moon, Dragonite, and Hisuian Samurott; repeatedly chip down walls like Clodsire, Ting-Lu, and Dondozo; and neutralize Kingambit safely by bypassing its Sucker Punch. Will-O-Wisp also pairs with Magma Storm quite nicely since the chip damage stacks up over time. 4 Defense EVs in conjunction with maximum HP investment guarantees Heatran will live an Earthquake from Clodsire. 40 Speed EVs allow Heatran to outspeed Adamant Kingambit so it can secure a Magma Storm or Will-O-Wisp on it before it can retaliate with Kowtow Cleave or Low Kick. Leftovers gives Heatran a form of recovery, which can prove useful in a match where it's tasked with checking numerous special threats throughout the course of a game. However, Air Balloon is also a good choice, as it allows Heatran to come in on Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Gliscor and Clodsire, and turn them into an opportunity to either trap them or get Stealth Rock up. Air Balloon also makes Heatran immune to Spikes, allowing it to come in much more safely against hazard stacking teams, and is a great item in general to emergency check Dragonite and Bulk Up Great Tusk with Will-O-Wisp. Flash Fire is generally the preferred ability of choice since it gives Heatran a Fire-type immunity to better check Iron Moth; however, Flame Body is also quite viable because it threatens burns against contact attackers such as Weavile, Meowscarada, and Rillaboom. Tera Grass allows Heatran to remove its weaknesses to Water- and Ground-type attacks so it can wall Water-types like Dondozo and Ogerpon-W and Ground-types like Clodsire, Ting-Lu, and Gliscor. Tera Grass also works well with Flash Fire to mitigate its newfound Fire weakness. Tera Ghost is used to remove its weakness to Fighting-type attacks so it can wall Zamazenta. Tera Ghost also gives it a Normal immunity, preventing Great Tusk from using Rapid Spin on it to remove its Stealth Rock and, if paired with Air Balloon, outright walling Dragonite if its only attacks are Extreme Speed and Earthquake or Fire Punch. Tera Fairy is also worth mentioning as a niche option to better check physical attackers like Roaring Moon and Zamazenta.</p> <p>Heatran is best used on Grassy Terrain bulky offense teams that appreciate its ability to check Fire-types while also being a great progress maker itself. Rillaboom is by far its best teammate, as they both have near-perfect synergy with each other; Rillaboom's Grassy Terrain not only provides additional recovery for it on top of Leftovers, it also weakens Earthquake from common Ground-types like Gliscor and Landorus-T. Rillaboom itself also threatens the Water- and Ground-types that constantly give Heatran trouble, like Gliscor, Alomomola, and Ogerpon-W, and brings in Heatran safely on its checks like Skarmory and Corviknight with U-turn. In return, Heatran is able to check Fire-types Rillaboom doesn't want to face, like Skeledirge and opposing Heatran. Great Tusk is another stellar teammate since Heatran is extremely weak to entry hazards, so its hazard removal support is much appreciated. Hatterene is a teammate that can prevent hazards from being set up altogether thanks to Magic Bounce and wall Gliscor in Grassy Terrain, which is super useful since Heatran often struggles to check numerous threats consistently when Spikes are on the field. Grassy Terrain sweepers like Hawlucha, Ogerpon-W, and Raging Bolt love Heatran's ability to wear down bulkier Pokemon like Skeledirge, Galarian Slowking, Dondozo, and Ting-Lu so they can clean up late-game. On bulkier teams, Alomomola is a fitting teammate for it since its Wish support allows Heatran to stay alive for a prolonged period of time, and its typing checks common physical Water-types like Barraskewda and Hisuian Samurott. Spikers like Hisuian Samurott, Gliscor, and Ting-Lu all work well with Heatran since they have good synergy typing-wise and their Spikes increases the potency of Magma Storm + Will-O-Wisp pressure. They can also form a hazard stacking core together with Stealth Rock Heatran.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Calm Mind Cresselia is a potent late-game wincon thanks to its gargantuan bulk, reliable recovery, and access to Calm Mind + Stored Power as well as solid coverage to deal with the Dark-types. After several Calm Mind boosts, Stored Power allows Cresselia to muscle past both Unaware walls like Skeledirge and Dondozo and bulky Psychic-resistant foes like Corviknight, Gholdengo, and Heatran while making it nigh impossible to KO with special attackers. Moonblast rounds out Cresselia's coverage, allowing it to hit Dark-types like Ting-Lu, Hisuian Samurott, and Greninja super effectively while being able to at least damage Kingambit; Tera Blast Fighting greatly improves Cresselia's matchup against Kingambit and hits these Dark-types harder than Moonblast, but makes Cresselia more reliant on Terastallization. Leftovers grants Cresselia crucial passive healing, allowing it to conserve its limited Moonlight PP long-term; Covert Cloak, on the other hand, blocks secondary effects from an array of moves, including Heatran's Magma Storm, Garganacl's Salt Cure, Zapdos's Discharge, and Sneasler's Dire Claw, allowing Cresselia to set up against these threats more safely. Grassy Seed is an option if Cresselia is used on Grassy Terrain hyper offense teams, which gives it more opprotunities to set up in the face of physical attackers while also boosting its Stored Power. Tera Poison has wonderful synergy with Levitate, giving Cresselia a single weakness to Psychic-type attacks, granting it resistances to Poison- and Fairy-type attacks, and an immunity to Toxapex's Toxic while still maintaining its Fighting resistance. Defensively, Tera Fighting lets Cresselia flip its Dark weakness against prominent Pokemon like Meowscarada, Greninja, Hisuian Samurott, and the aforementioned Kingambit as well. 52 Speed EVs allow Cresselia to outspeed Kingambit.</p> <p>Cresselia fits well on an array of hyper offense, offense, and balance teams capable of supporting such a potent wincon. Heatran, Hisuian Samurott, and Landorus-T can provide entry hazard support to wear down foes over time. Heatran can also use Will-O-Wisp to cripple Kingambit or trap and wear down threats like Haze Toxapex and Chilly Reception Galarian Slowking with Magma Storm and Taunt; in return, Cresselia can handle threats like Great Tusk and Zamazenta that Heatran struggles against. Kingambit is ubiquitous and is a major thorn in Cresselia's side; as such, Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, and Low Kick Kingambit are crucial partners that can help stop opposing Kingambit's attempt to countersweep. Assault Vest Toxapex is a great teammate for Cresselia; it can take on Encore Iron Valiant, which is a frustrating matchup for Cresselia, and it can trap and deal with opposing defensive Toxapex, which can shut down Cresselia's boosts with Haze and force Cresselia to Tera Poison in order to avoid being crippled by Toxic. Thanks to Grassy Surge, Rillaboom is a necessary partner for Grassy Seed variants; it can support Cresselia with utility options like Knock Off and U-turn too.</p>"

      "Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<p>Darkrai is an excellent wallbreaker and cleaner, gaining many opportunities to use Nasty Plot due to its amazing base Speed and a diverse coverage movepool backed up with a good Special Attack stat and enough bulk to set up against passive Pokemon. Ice Beam hits Dragon- and Ground-type Pokemon like Raging Bolt, Roaring Moon, Gliscor, and Great Tusk that can take its Dark Pulse. Sludge Bomb hits Fairy-types like Clefable, Iron Valiant, Primarina, and Enamorus as well as Pokemon that commonly use Tera Fairy like Gholdengo, and Garganacl. Focus Blast tears through bulky Dark-types like Ting-Lu and Kingambit as well as Blissey. Psyshock can be used to hit Blissey and Clodsire; however, Clodsire can Terastallize to avoid being KOed if needed. Life Orb gives Darkrai a ton of power at the cost of longevity, granting it an OHKO on maximum HP Great Tusk with unboosted Ice Beam. Focus Sash turns Darkrai into an emergency check to Booster Energy Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Iron Boulder, and Roaring Moon if its Focus Sash is maintained. Tera Poison boosts Darkrai's Sludge Bomb and allows it to avoid revenge killing attempts from Iron Valiant and Zamazenta thanks to the Fairy- and Fighting-type resistances it gains. Tera Fighting can be used to power up Focus Blast to extreme levels of power to become Darkrai's strongest viable move, notably being able to OHKO Ting-Lu at +2 after Stealth Rock, and combined with a Life Orb, it gives Darkrai a chance to outright OHKO Blissey at +2.</p> <p>Darkrai's wallbreaking capabilities are useful on offensively oriented teams, having strong synergies with other Dark-types like Roaring Moon and Kingambit and other special attackers like Raging Bolt and Dragapult. Roaring Moon and Kingambit pair with Darkrai to overwhelm or lure shared checks like Zamazenta and Iron Valiant while gaining opportunities to wallbreak by switching into each other's counters. Darkrai's Bad Dreams punishes Dondozo's Rest, further enhancing its synergy with Kingambit and Roaring Moon as well as other physical Pokemon like Zamazenta, as switching into Darkrai as Dondozo comes in to wall them will result in Bad Dreams chip without burning a sleep turn. Raging Bolt and Dragapult appreciate Darkrai's ability to break through balance teams, tearing through walls like Ting-Lu and Galarian Slowking, while mixed Dragapult and Raging Bolt, especially with Taunt, can help break through Clodsire. Dragapult provides a stop to Zamazenta and punishes Kingambit with Will-O-Wisp if Darkrai isn't running Focus Blast. Darkrai appreciates support from entry hazard setters like Hisuian Samurott, Landorus-T, and Glimmora, as their hazards, especially Spikes, make Darkrai much more threatening, wearing down switch-ins like Zamazenta, Ting-Lu, and Heatran. Darkrai heavily pressures hazard removers like Great Tusk, Corviknight, and Cinderace. Hisuian Samurott and Landorus-T in particular have deeper synergy with Darkrai; Hisuian Samurott wears down Primarina, switches into Darkrai checks like Blissey and Clodsire to set up Spikes on forced switches, and can use Flip Turn to safely bring in Darkrai on physically defensive Pokemon like Corviknight, Dondozo, and Alomomola to gain free turns. Landorus-T is an excellent physical blanket check and can switch into threatening Fighting-types like Zamazenta and Booster Energy Great Tusk that can threaten Darkrai, and it can use U-turn to bring in Darkrai safely on Pokemon like Gliscor and opposing Landorus-T. Gholdengo is an excellent teammate due to it providing a check to Fairy-types like Iron Valiant and Enamorus while being able to counter most Zamazenta variants if running a physically defensive set. Rillaboom can threaten answers to Darkrai like Primarina, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire while being able to pivot Darkrai in on Pokemon like defensive Gholdengo, Skarmory, and Corviknight to keep up momentum. Assault Vest Primarina is an excellent partner that blanket checks many special attackers including Iron Valiant and Deoxys-S, pivots Darkrai in on its checks like Galarian Slowking, and pressures shared walls such as Blissey and Terastallized Clodsire for Darkrai to break through.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Darkrai, owing to its already impressive Speed stat, is among one of the tier's most consistent revenge killers and an outstanding piece of speed control. Outspeeding the entirety of OU's metagame, Choice Scarf Darkrai reliably threatens Iron Valiant, Deoxys-S, and Enamorus. It can also threaten other, more specially bulky Pokemon with prior chip damage. Sludge Bomb is mandatory to threaten Fairy-types like Enamorus and Iron Valiant. Focus Blast is used to smash Steel-types and Dark-types like Hisuian Samurott, Kingambit, and Iron Treads. Ice Beam effectively forces out many common Ground-types like Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Gliscor, which otherwise could easily set up entry hazards against it. Trick can be used over the previous two moves, as it allows Darkrai to incapacitate a sweeper, like Dragonite, or a wall, like Clodsire, long-term and grants it the flexibility of being able to switch moves. Tera Poison is used to strengthen Sludge Bomb's damage output, allowing it to threaten the bulkier Clefable while also coming with the added benefit of resisting the many Fairy-types' Moonblast, Zamazenta's STAB moves, and letting survive Rillaboom's Grassy Glide in a pinch. Tera Dark is a solid offensive option, turning many 3HKOs like against Walking Wake into 2HKOs. Additionally, late-game, a boosted Dark Pulse can easily clean up a weakened team. Tera Fighting can also be used with Focus Blast, giving the move incredible power that allows Darkrai to OHKO Roaring Moon and Heatran, and it can 2HKO the mighty Ting-Lu.</p> <p>Darkrai fits best on offensive teams that necessitate its revenge killing talents. It’s important to note that Darkrai actually has issues revenge killing as a result of Terastallization, with many usually clean revenge kills being complicated by this mechanic. This issue is only compounded by the fact that all of Darkrai’s moves all have common switch-ins, so it’s very important to have other answers to the Pokemon Darkrai aims to revenge kill. As a result, Primarina is a solid partner, with its typing and firepower being able to check switch-ins to Dark Pulse like Iron Valiant, Enamrous, and Heatran, safely scout for potential Terastallizations against them, and provide momentum with Flip Turn. Landorus-T is similarly a good partner, with its ability to check physical attackers that Darkrai can't safely revenge kill in the event of Terastallization, such as Roaring Moon, Dragonite, and Great Tusk; it also provides momentum with U-turn and helps put Darkrai's victims into range of its attacks with Stealth Rock. Additionally, it can disrupt many of Darkrai switch-ins with Taunt, like Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Blissey. On the topic of entry hazards, Great Tusk and Cinderace are also good partners, as they provide hazard control that is seriously appreciated by Darkrai, which otherwise will get chipped down as it switches in and out of the field to apply pressure. Great Tusk checks many priority users that would otherwise deny Darkrai its ability to revenge kill, such as Kingambit, Raging Bolt, and Dragonite. It also can pressure Clodsire, Ting-Lu, and Garganacl, denying their hazards and threatening them with significant damage that prevents them from switching into Darkrai. Cinderace is effective as a result of its ability to remove entry hazards Court Change and spread burns to Pokemon that could otherwise outpace Darkrai, such as Rillaboom and Dragonite, while its U-turn dents Hisuian Samurott. Dragapult is also a great partner due to its anti-offensive nature, with its speedy Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave allowing it to be Darkrai's fallback line in the event of an unexpected Tera. It handles many switch-ins like Rillaboom, the Ogerpon formes, and Zamazenta by debilitating them with status and providing pivoting with U-turn. Dragapult can also deconstruct stall, which Darkrai matches up poorly into. Kingambit also loves Darkrai's ability to outpace Iron Valiant, as Darkrai opens up Kingambit late-game by KOing or at least forcing chip damage on key targets, putting them in range of Sucker Punch. Furthermore, Darkrai can also cripple physical walls like Dondozo and Skarmory with Trick, while Darkrai enjoys Kingambit's Sucker Punch putting targets in range of its attacks and Iron Head eliminating Clefable and Primarina. Raging Bolt is an effective partner, as Darkrai's ability to use Trick and shut down special walls like Blissey, Skeledirge, and Clodsire is great for opening it up against bulkier teams. Darkrai's coverage in Focus Blast can help simplify Raging Bolt's endgame, as it pressures Ting-Lu, Roaring Moon and Kingambit, notably simplifying the mindgames between it and Kingambit, while Ice Beam can also help eliminate Ground-types like Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Gliscor for it to use Thunderclap late-game.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive": {
        "description": "<p>Leveraging its high Speed, impressive power, and access to a wide range of coverage moves, Darkrai is able to thrive in OU as a powerful wallbreaker and disruption tool. Sludge Bomb complements Darkrai's STAB Dark Pulse by targeting Fairy-types like Clefable, Primarina, and Hatterene while also giving Darkrai powerful coverage into Ogerpon-W. Focus Blast enhances Darkrai's coverage further by targeting bulky Dark-types like Kingambit, Ting-Lu, and Roaring Moon, and Ice Beam lets Darkrai OHKO Gliscor and Landorus-T while being its strongest option against Great Tusk, Raging Bolt, and Dragonite. Darkrai's deep movepool can be explored to further customize its role on a team by trading out some of its coverage for utility. Knock Off can provide fantastic support by removing Heavy-Duty Boots from switch-ins like Clodsire and Blissey, while it is possible to delve deeper into Darkrai's utility movepool to give it even more potent options against defensive switch-ins, such as Will-O-Wisp to permanently neuter physical attackers and Taunt to shut down both recovery moves and status effects from Blissey and Clodsire. Finally, Sucker Punch is a niche option that is able to pick off weakened foes like Dragapult and Deoxys-S that would otherwise be able to revenge kill it; when using Sucker Punch, a spread of 4 Atk / 252 SpA / 252 Spe with a Naive nature is optimal to minimize damage from common priority moves like Dragonite's Extreme Speed and Rillaboom's Grassy Glide, though a Hasty nature can be useful to take on Raging Bolt's Thunderclap. Life Orb is a fantastic option that bolsters Darkrai's power even further, giving it a clean 2HKO on Corviknight after Stealth Rock along with OHKOs on max HP Great Tusk with Ice Beam and Ogerpon-W with Sludge Bomb after any entry hazard chip; with Life Orb, 29 HP IVs can be used to minimize recoil. Alternatively, Expert Belt takes advantage of Darkrai's excellent coverage without sacrificing its longevity, maintaining OHKOs on offensive Gholdengo and Enamorus; Heavy-Duty Boots improves Darkrai's longevity further, but the loss in power not only sacrifices the aforementioned benchmarks, it also leaves Darkrai unable to safely 2HKO Galarian Slowking. Tera Poison is a fantastic option both offensively and defensively on Darkrai. With Life Orb or Expert Belt, Tera Poison Sludge Bomb is able to OHKO Clefable, Hatterene, and Alolan Ninetales and 2HKO Assault Vest Primarina, and even without a boosting item, it can OHKO both Ogerpon-W and Rillaboom. In turn, Tera Poison flips Darkrai's Fighting- and Fairy-type weaknesses into resistances, allowing it to take hits from Iron Valiant, Zamazenta, and Choice Scarf Enamorus if necessary, as well as granting it a resistance to Rillaboom's Grassy Glide. Tera Fighting can instead be considered to increase the power of Darkrai's Focus Blast to monstrous levels at the expense of not granting much defensive value; Tera-boosted Focus Blast allows Expert Belt Darkrai to 2HKO even Ting-Lu, and grants Life Orb Darkrai a roll in its favor to 2HKO Blissey.</p> <p>Darkrai provides a huge amount of value to offense teams that appreciate its high Speed along with its ability to threaten Galarian Slowking, though even slower, more balanced teams can still find value in its ability to threaten a significant proportion of the tier and force switches to take advantage of entry hazards. Landorus-T is a strong partner that can not only set Stealth Rock but is also able to switch in on threats to Darkrai like Zamazenta and help to offset Darkrai's relative frailty by bringing it in safely with U-turn. Similarly, Gliscor makes a good pairing on bulkier structures with its ability to come in on both Zamazenta and Clodsire. As Darkrai typically makes its home on more offensive builds, partners that can handle Darkrai's checks without being momentum sinks are much appreciated; Assault Vest Primarina forms a great core with Darkrai, able to switch in on Iron Valiant and Enamorus and force them out. Primarina also appreciates Darkrai threatening Galarian Slowking. Offensively, special attackers like Iron Valiant and Raging Bolt that can help to overload shared checks like Clodsire and Blissey make great partners. Darkrai doesn't only work with special overload, though; Dark-type spam teams benefit greatly from Darkrai pressuring and being able to deal heavy damage to threats like Clefable, Ting-Lu, and Primarina, allowing for threats like Roaring Moon and Weavile to later break through. In return, Roaring Moon, Weavile, and other Dark-type attackers like Kingambit are able to weaken Zamazenta for Darkrai while also being able to take advantage of Darkrai's more passive switch-ins like Clodsire and Blissey; Ogerpon-W is another powerful partner that can force damage onto Zamazenta and turn passive walls into setup fodder. Hisuian Samurott is another partner that benefits from this support in overloading shared checks while also setting up Spikes, which Darkrai appreciates greatly. Particularly when opting not to run Heavy-Duty Boots, Darkrai appreciates hazard removal to give it more turns on the field; Great Tusk is a natural pick that is also able to pressure Zamazenta and can invite in Iron Valiant to burn its Booster Energy. Another partner that can help Darkrai both defensively and offensively is Gholdengo, as Gholdengo can switch in on Fighting- and Fairy-type attacks from Iron Valiant, Zamazenta, and Clefable while Gholdengo in turn appreciates Darkrai's ability to weaken or eliminate opposing Dark-types like Ting-Lu, Kingambit, and Hisuian Samurott. Bulkier teams can opt to pair Galarian Slowking with Darkrai with its ability to pivot around Enamorus, Iron Valiant, and Zamazenta, and the Future Sight support it provides turns Darkrai into a devastating threat that Clodsire cannot switch into and Zamazenta cannot safely force out.</p>"

  "Serperior": {
    "sets": {
      "Contrary Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>Serperior fills the role of a late-game sweeper for offensive teams that snowballs quickly while attacking thanks to Contrary Leaf Storm. Tera Blast gives Serperior the strong coverage that it sorely lacks, as without Terastallizing, Serperior is very prone to being walled. Tera Blast Ground is the most ideal choice, as it deals heavy damage to Pokemon like Heatran, Galarian Slowking, Raging Bolt, Gouging Fire, and Gholdengo that do not fear Leaf Storm. Tera Blast Fire trades a strong hit on Pokemon like Galarian Slowking, Heatran, and the Dragon-types for a way to immediately threaten Corviknight and Skarmory as well as common Air Balloon users like Gholdengo and Kingambit. Glare is used to punish the switches Serperior often forces, allowing it to cripple common answers like Heatran and Skeledirge without having to commit to using Tera. Substitute allows Serperior to scout switches and fish for full paralysis turns while also blocking status such as Toxic from Gliscor, resulting in easier setup. Additionally, having a Substitute up forces many faster potential revenge killers like Zamazenta and Darkrai to risk a strong hit or paralysis to break it. Dragon Pulse can be used over Substitute as a non-Tera reliant way to deal with common Dragon-types likeRaging Bolt, Dragonite, and Kyurem. Leftovers helps to keep Serperior healthy throughout the match, most notably allowing it to make more Substitutes. The Tera types chosen are primarily to aid in coverage, but they also have a few defensive applications of note. Tera Ground can enable Serperior to safely use Substitute against Sludge Bomb from Galarian Slowking in a pinch, potentially allowing for a free turn of setup. It also prevents Thunder Wave Infiltrator Dragapult from paralyzing Serperior though a Substitute. Tera Fire allows Serperior to resist Triple Axel from Meowscarada and Weavile, a move that otherwise threatens to OHKO Serperior even through a Substitute, as well as U-turn from both Cinderace and Meowscarada.</p> <p>Serperior only fits on heavily offensive teams, primarily Sticky Web offense. Ribombee is a great teammate, as it is the premier Sticky Web setter. Sticky Web allows Serperior to outspeed otherwise faster Pokemon like non-Clear Body Dragapult and Booster Energy Iron Valiant. In turn, threat of a Contrary Evasion boost from Defog or a Contrary Speed boost from its own Sticky Web due to Court Change helps to ensure that entry hazards stay up. For the same reason, Serperior helps to shore up an offensive team's matchup against opposing Sticky Web teams because of the threat of a Speed boost. Serperior is very Tera reliant, so it wants teammates that can help it to make the most of the Tera investment and do not need Tera themselves like Gholdengo and Zamazenta. It is best used alongside Pokemon that appreciate paralysis support and provide heavy offensive pressure, like Gouging Fire and Kingambit. Other entry hazard leads like Hisuian Samurott and Glimmora also support Serperior well, as many of Serperior's checks are grounded such as Raging Bolt and Gouging Fire, making them vulnerable to Spikes and Toxic Spikes. Landorus-T is another good teammate for Serperior, as it provides Stealth Rock, uses U-turn to get Serperior in safely against common Pokemon like Gliscor, and threatens Serperior's checks like Heatran and Galarian Slowking with Earthquake. Arguably the biggest threat to Serperior is Gholdengo, as it can repeatedly switch into Leaf Storm and is immune to Glare. Galarian Slowking similarly cares very little about Leaf Storm and does not mind the Speed drop from paralysis. Roaring Moon is a notable teammate because it fits on the same team structures as Serperior, appreciates the paralysis support, and offensively threatens these problematic Pokemon. Kingambit is similarly a good partner, as it can switch in against both of these Pokemon and threaten them with heavy damage. Kingambit also appreciates paralysis on Pokemon like Corviknight, Kyurem, and Roaring Moon, which Kingambit can beat one-on-one thanks to the Speed drop. Kyurem dislikes risking paralysis but takes little damage from Serperior and heavily threatens it and many of Serperior's frail offensive teammates. Teammates like Air Balloon Gholdengo can help to sponge Kyurem's hits while adding more offensive pressure. Gholdengo can use Nasty Plot-boosted attacks like Shadow Ball and Psyshock to help break Galarian Slowking, Blissey, and Clodsire for Serperior while blocking hazard removal. Iron Valiant can help to wear down shared checks like the previously mentioned Poison-types, especially with Knock Off or Calm Mind sets, while Raging Bolt can similarly can be used to chip down special walls with Calm Mind-boosted attacks. Lastly, Rillaboom can provide Knock Off and U-turn on top of setting Grassy Terrain that can boost Leaf Storm and help Serperior to make more Substitutes.</p>"

  "Samurott-Hisui": {
    "sets": {
      "Lead": {
        "description": "<p>Hisuian Samurott establishes itself as a top-tier dedicated lead thanks to its signature move Ceaseless Edge, letting it threaten the opposition while reliably setting up layers of Spikes that bypass common entry hazard preventions such as Hatterene's Magic Bounce and Taunt from Deoxys-S and Landorus-T. It does so while still maintaining a decent offensive presence courtesy of its strong Sharpness-boosted STAB combination and a bevy of disruptive utility options. Though weaker, Aqua Cutter is a perfectly-accurate alternative over Razor Shell that notably ignores common contact effects like Landorus-T's Rocky Helmet, Heatran's Flame Body, and Zapdos's Static at the cost of potentially missing out on the 2HKO against Ting-Lu. Aqua Jet reliably picks off opposing Focus Sash leads like Deoxys-S, Glimmora, and Ribombee as well as targeting other faster Pokemon like Cinderace and Great Tusk. Alternatively, Sucker Punch lets Hisuian Samurott hit faster Water-resistant Pokemon like Ogerpon-W and Choice Specs Dragapult, the latter of which can be problematic in the offense mirror. Aside from being handy against bulky foes like Skarmory and Pelipper, Knock Off removing Heavy-Duty Boots works extremely well with Spikes, making the likes of Alomomola, Dondozo, and Unaware Clefable susceptible to them, which is especially helpful because the latter two can trouble the hyper offense teams that Hisuian Samurott supports. Either Taunt or Encore prevents Hisuian Samurott from being used as setup fodder by the likes of Raging Bolt and Kingambit, and it messes with defensive foes like Clefable. More specifically, Taunt stops Gliscor, Ting-Lu, and Skarmory from setting hazards and prevents slower offensive threats like Dragonite from setting up. Alternatively, Encore is better at punishing naturally faster setup sweepers like Roaring Moon, Iron Defense Zamazenta, and Nasty Plot Darkrai looking for that one free turn of setup, and it can subsequently provide valuable switch-in and setup opportunities for an incoming teammate. Sacred Sword hits Roaring Moon, Meowscarada, and opposing Hisuian Samurott; cleanly OHKOes Weavile, Darkrai, and bulky Kingambit; and breaks IronPress Zamazenta's Substitute. Focus Sash guarantees at least one layer of Spikes can be set even against faster foes like Enamorus, as well as opposing leads like Ribombee. Tera Ghost is predominantly used to spinblock foes like Great Tusk and Iron Treads in a pinch.</p> <p>Hisuian Samurott's ability to set the pace for its team early-game makes it a perfect fit on hyper offense teams. Setup sweepers like Kingambit and Roaring Moon enjoy its Spikes putting foes into their KO range, especially against their checks like Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Heatran. Dragon Dance Roaring Moon and other Knock Off users like Bulk Up Great Tusk and Iron Valiant can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Dondozo, Galarian Slowking, and Gholdengo to make them vulnerable to Spikes. If not going for Knock Off, Great Tusk can also provide entry hazard removal for the team with Rapid Spin, since Hisuian Samurott will trigger lead Glimmora's Toxic Debris twice; pairing Hisuian Samurott with a grounded offensive Poison-type like Iron Moth can also mitigate this issue. In addition to enjoying Spikes, the aforementioned Iron Valiant and other Pokemon like Deoxys-S and Choice Scarf Enamorus are potent late-game cleaners that can notably pressure Great Tusk, preventing it from ever entering the field to use Rapid Spin. Ghost-types like Gholdengo and Dragapult are valuable teammates to naturally spinblock foes like Great Tusk and Iron Treads; moreover, Gholdengo is adept at preventing other hazard removal attempts such as Corviknight's Defog and Glimmora's Mortal Spin, while Dragapult can deal with or revenge kill Zamazenta behind a Substitute, which uses Knock Off Hisuian Samurott as setup fodder. In return, they appreciate Spikes chipping down the likes of Kingambit, Ting-Lu, and Garganacl.</p>"
      },
      "Boots Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>With Sharpness powering up its STAB moves, Hisuian Samurott is a powerful attacker in addition to providing strong support for offensive teams with the Spikes it sets with Ceaseless Edge; it also has the ability to pivot safely thanks to Heavy-Duty Boots. Razor Shell and Aqua Cutter are comparably strong STAB options, the difference being Razor Shell trades a slight dip of accuracy for the ability to chip down walls with Defense drops, and Aqua Cutter is slightly weaker but is fully accurate and has a chance for damage to spike upwards with the higher critical hit rate while also avoiding contact effects like Rocky Helmet and Moltres' Flame Body. Knock Off removes Heavy-Duty Boots from Hisuian Samurott's foes and thus leaves them susceptible to the Spikes produced by Ceaseless Edge, as well as removing Rocky Helmet, which opens it up to keep attacking with its contact moves. As a support option, Encore is useful to lock Pokemon like Alomomola and Dondozo into setup moves, while Flip Turn can keep up momentum, help Hisuian Samurott escape from unfavorable matchups against slower foes like Primarina, and keep pressure on the opponent by pivoting between teammates smoothly. Heavy-Duty Boots provides Hisuian Samurott the immunity to entry hazards, which lets it be far more active throughout the course of a game. Tera Fire gives Hisuian Samurott an immunity to burns and provides it with a free turn against a foe attempting to burn it such as Moltres. It also flips Hisuian Samurott's weakness against otherwise problematic Grass- and Fairy-types like Iron Valiant, Enamorus, and Rillaboom, especially with Heavy-Duty Boots to mitigate its Stealth Rock weakness after Terastallizing.</p> <p>Hisuian Samurott fits well on offense teams and specifically is very useful on entry hazard stack structures. Stealth Rock users such as Landorus-T and Tinkaton make good partners for Hisuian Samurott, which also spreads entry hazards with Ceaseless Edge, creating hazard stacking cores to put pressure on foes. Hisuian Samurott's ability to pivot with Flip Turn synergizes well with other offensive pivots like Cinderace and Dragapult, allowing the team to pressure opposing Pokemon as well as pivot to any potential counters. Hisuian Samurott struggles to make progress on its own against bulkier Pokemon that resist its STAB moves like Alomomola, Dondozo, and Zamazenta. Zamazenta can easily dispatch Hisuian Samurott with a Fighting-type STAB move with no way for it to damage Zamazenta back. A strong Fairy-type like Enamorus or Iron Valiant can help deal with Zamazenta while also forming an offensive core with Hisuian Samurott, which can deal with threats to them like Galarian Slowking, easily switching in on Psychic-type moves like Future Sight. These Fairy-types also pose a threat to Hisuian Samurott, outspeeding and threatening it with Moonblast; teammates like Gholdengo, Iron Crown, Tinkaton, and Kingambit can cover these Pokemon, the former two adding to the offensive pressure of the whole team with more special attacks to complement Hisuian Samurott's physical attacks. Gholdengo especially synergizes with Hisuian Samurott, as it's able to efficiently block entry hazard removal and keep up the Spikes set by Ceaseless Edge. Kingambit, on the other hand, is similar to Hisuian Samurott, as it's a physical attacker and can help break down their shared checks like Dondozo and Skarmory over the course of a game. Together, along with other Dark-types like Roaring Moon, Hisuian Samurott can become a powerful part of Dark-type spam archetypes that can overwhelm shared counters such as Dondozo and Clefable. Galarian Slowking is another teammate that can deal with Fairy-types, shrugging off Moonblast as well as Fighting-type moves from Hisuian Samurott's counters like Zamazenta, which it can also force out with Future Sight. Hisuian Samurott also struggles against offensive Pokemon that outspeed it and can take advantage of that to pivot, such as Cinderace, Dragapult, and Ogerpon. Having some speed control such as Ribombee's Sticky Web can assist with this while synergizing with the rest of Hisuian Samurott's hazards.</p>"
      },
      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Hisuian Samurott is a great speed control option due to its ability to compress a number of roles in one slot. It can revenge kill faster Pokemon such as Cinderace and Dragapult while simultaneously setting up Spikes with Ceaseless Edge or pivoting into other teammates with Flip Turn. Razor Shell can make Hisuian Samurott more difficult to respond to due to its high chance to lower the enemy's Defense. However, Aqua Cutter can be used instead, as it is more accurate and does not make contact; this is useful against targets such as Rocky Helmet Landorus-T and Flame Body Moltres. Knock Off complements Ceaseless Edge by removing items such as Rocky Helmet and Heavy-Duty Boots, making it more rewarding for Hisuian Samurott to use Ceaseless Edge later. Flip Turn allows Hisuian Samurott to pivot out of bad matchups against Clefable and Primarina while also dealing chip damage and generating momentum. However, Sacred Sword can be used to revenge kill various threats such as Kingambit and other Hisuian Samurott. Hisuian Samurott is a mediocre Terastallization user, as its base typing is important to check threats such as Gholdengo and non-Low Kick Kingambit, and its partners will usually benefit from Terastallization more. Nonetheless, Hisuian Samurott can benefit from the damage increase that either Tera Water or Tera Dark provide to revenge kill a wider pool of Pokemon. Tera Water is useful to revenge kill offensive Great Tusk and Landorus-T more reliably, while Tera Dark allows Hisuian Samurott to OHKO defensive Galarian Slowking and Latias with Ceaseless Edge after Stealth Rock damage. Tera Ghost is another worthwhile consideration, as it allows Hisuian Samurott to block Rapid Spin from Great Tusk and Iron Treads.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Hisuian Samurott best fits on bulky offense teams, as it provides a great deal of utility between its defensive profile, ability to set up Spikes, Knock Off, and pivoting capabilities. Landorus-T is the perfect partner; it can form a potent pivoting core with Hisuian Samurott and provide Stealth Rock support while simultaneously benefiting from Hisuian Samurott's Spikes due to its ability to force switches with Intimidate and Rocky Helmet. Hisuian Samurott has a difficult time maintaining Spikes against entry hazard removers such as Corviknight and Great Tusk, as well as struggling against Fighting-types such as Zamazenta. Dragapult is thus a fantastic teammate; it matches up well against common switch-ins to Hisuian Samurott such as Corviknight and Skarmory and can block Rapid Spin from Great Tusk. Air Balloon Gholdengo is also an excellent partner, as it can prevent Defog from Corviknight, safely prevent Rapid Spin attempts from Great Tusk and Iron Treads, and check Fighting-types such as Zamazenta and Iron Valiant. In turn, Hisuian Samurott's Ceaseless Edge support makes Dragapult and Gholdengo more difficult to switch into due to wearing down their switch-ins such as Kingambit and Ting-Lu. Sweepers such as Iron Valiant and Kingambit appreciate Hisuian Samurott's ability to lay down Spikes, as it makes it easier for them to clean late-game and break through checks such as Hatterene and Great Tusk. Future Sight support from Galarian Slowking is beneficial, as it makes it more difficult for Pokemon like Zamazenta and Iron Valiant to switch into Ceaseless Edge. Hisuian Samurott itself is quite vulnerable to being worn down by hazards, so anti-entry hazard support from Hatterene or Great Tusk is appreciated. While Choice Scarf Hisuian Samurott is relatively fast, it is still prone to being outsped by various setup sweepers such as Roaring Moon, Iron Valiant, and Iron Boulder. Priority support from Rillaboom or Dragonite is therefore recommended to have additional insurance against these threats.</p>"
      },
      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<p>Hisuian Samurott is a Pokemon that, unlike other entry hazard setters, can offensively threaten teams while getting hazards up thanks to Sharpness-boosted Ceaseless Edge, allowing for more aggressive play and more opportunities to lay Spikes. Ceaseless Edge also lets it get Spikes up against Pokemon such as Hatterene and Taunt Deoxys-S. With Assault Vest, Hisuian Samurott is able to utilize its increased special bulk to check Pokemon like Heatran, Gholdengo, and Dragapult. Additionally, its decent defensive typing is useful for checking other threats like Weavile and Kingambit lacking Low Kick and Tera Blast Fairy. Razor Shell is generally the preferred Water-type STAB move due to its chance to lower Defense, but Aqua Cutter is a viable alternative due to it being non-contact and thus preventing chip damage from Rocky Helmet, which helps against Pokemon like Skarmory and Great Tusk. Aqua Jet gives Hisuian Samurott a priority move to pick off faster, weakened threats like Glimmora, Great Tusk, and Iron Boulder. Sucker Punch is another option for priority; it is not as reliable as Aqua Jet, but it is stronger and better at revenge killing Dragapult, Deoxys-S, and Raging Bolt. Knock Off punishes defensive Pokemon that can impede progress, removing items from foes such as Dondozo, Skarmory, and Primarina. Alternatively, Flip Turn can be used to preserve momentum and safely bring in threats like Iron Valiant and Ogerpon-W. 84 Speed EVs let Hisuian Samurott outspeed uninvested Gliscor; the leftover EVs are put into HP to increase its overall bulk. Tera Poison is used to remove its weaknesses to Fighting, Fairy, and Grass so it can take attacks from Pokemon like Zamazenta, Iron Valiant, and Serperior.</p> <p>Assault Vest Hisuian Samurott fits best on entry hazard-stacking bulky offense teams that appreciate its offensive presence and ability to take special attacks. Gholdengo is an especially good teammate for Hisuian Samurott, since it blocks all hazard removal bar Court Change from Cinderace and has good matchups against Fairy- and Fighting-types that annoy Hisuian Samurott like Clefable and Zamazenta. In return, Hisuian Samurott soft checks Heatran and Iron Moth. Due to Hisuian Samurott's lack of reliable recovery, pairing it with Pokemon that have titanic special bulk or high longevity like Ting-Lu or Galarian Slowking is encouraged to cover special threats throughout the course of a game. Ting-Lu also has access to Stealth Rock, which, when paired with Spikes and Hisuian Samurott's ability to remove Heavy-Duty Boots, can rack up serious chip damage on the opposing team. Alternative Knock Off users such as Great Tusk, Rillaboom, and Clefable are good for removing Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon that never come in against Hisuian Samurott like Galarian Slowking, Gholdengo, and opposing Great Tusk. On top of being a premier pick for bulky offense teams, Great Tusk has the added perk of having access to Rapid Spin, removing hazards the opponent tries to set up so Hisuian Samurott can win the hazard war. Additionally, Rillaboom is able to provide Hisuian Samurott passive recovery thanks to Grassy Terrain. Other offensive teammates that appreciate Hisuian Samurott's ability to set Spikes include, but are not limited to, Kingambit, and Ogerpon-W.</p>"

  "Excadrill": {
    "sets": {
      "Sand Sweeper": {
        "description": "<p>Excadrill serves as the main sweeper on sand teams, as well as being the main entry hazard remover these teams need. Swords Dance lets it reach thresholds like 2HKOing Alomomola with a +2 Earthquake and Gliscor with +2 Iron Head, with its typing allowing to set up on Pokemon like Raging Bolt, Galarian Slowking, and non-Air Balloon Gholdengo. Rapid Spin lets Excadrill remove hazards and outspeed threats like Darkrai outside of sand. Air Balloon is the preferred item to have a temporary immunity to Spikes and Ground-type moves coming from the likes of Landorus-T and Great Tusk. Leftovers can be useful to regain some health over the course of the battle. Heavy-Duty Boots is also an option to ignore hazards entirely, especially useful for clearing Sticky Web. Tera Fire's main appeal is that it gives Excadrill an advantage over Moltres and other common users of Will-O-Wisp like Dragapult and Cinderace. Tera Ground allows Excadrill to guarantee OHKOing targets such as Iron Treads and Raging Bolt unboosted. Tera Ghost provides a crucial immunity to Fighting-type moves like Close Combat and Body Press from Pokemon such as Zamazenta, Corviknight, and Skarmory. Tera Flying is another option that still allows Excadrill to resist Fighting while having the benefit of flipping the matchup versus Ground-types like Landorus-T, Great Tusk, and Ting-Lu.</p> <p>Tyranitar is Excadrill's best friend, setting the sand that Excadrill needs to thrive while also packing Stealth Rock and Knock Off, which can soften the enemy team to the point where Excadrill can sweep. Tyranitar helps beat Zapdos and, most importantly, Moltres, which Excadrill struggles to break through. The greatest problem sand teams face is Roar Zamazenta, which can shuffle them around while threatening a powerful Body Press. Similarly, Corviknight and Skarmory can boost with Iron Defense in the face of Excadrill while punishing contact moves with Rocky Helmet. Therefore, partners like Primarina, Gholdengo, and Sinistcha are great teammates; in return, Excadrill threatens their counters like Darkrai and Iron Moth. Another highly troublesome matchup for these teams is Ogerpon-W, which resists both of Excadrill's STAB moves. For this reason, checks like Corviknight and Skarmory are recommended. Corviknight can provide momentum with U-turn and can use Defog to ease Excadrill's stress. Meanwhile, Skarmory has Spikes, which can force even more passive damage alongside sand. Hydrapple and Sinistcha can check Rillaboom, Dondozo, Zamazenta, and Ogerpon-W, with Hydrapple providing extra breaking power with its ability to boost with Nasty Plot and Sinistcha providing a reliable defensive backbone with Strength Sap and Matcha Gotcha. Ironically enough, Ogerpon-W is a great partner for Excadrill due to its ability to brute force its way through troublesome matchups like Corviknight, Skarmory, and Moltres; it also has utility moves like U-turn for momentum and Encore to lock foes into moves Excadrill can use as an entry point, like Protect on Gliscor and Calm Mind on Raging Bolt. Ogerpon-W is also able to absorb Water-type moves, protecting both Excadrill and Tyranitar in the process. Finally, Ogerpon-W is able to bait in Pokemon that are scared of Excadrill, like Raging Bolt. Swords Dance Gliscor is an excellent partner for Excadrill, as it excels at defeating both Zapdos and Moltres thanks to its better resilience and status immunity. Dragapult is a good addition to these teams thanks to its immediate power, the ability to cripple various counters like the aforementioned Zamazenta and Ogerpon-W with Will-O-Wisp, and capacity to bring momentum with U-turn. Moltres also brings status and momentum-generating to the table, but it trades greater Speed and power for greater longevity with both Roost and better defenses. Assault Vest Galarian Slowking can help relieve some pressure from Tyranitar, Excadrill's best teammate, thanks to its hit-taking abilities, which is especially relevant against Primarina and Walking Wake.</p>"

The combination of Wish, Regenerator, and Flip Turn makes it the premier Wish passer in OU, able to heal defensive teammates without reliable recovery like Dondozo and Ting-Lu. Scald bolsters Alomomola's defensive presence, with its burn chance permanently threatening physical attackers such as Kingambit, Roaring Moon, Weavile, and Meowscarada while cutting down the longevity of switch-ins like Galarian Slowking and opposing Alomomola. Flip Turn separates Alomomola from other bulky Water-types as a slow pivot, letting it bring in other Pokemon safely while creating momentum on the slower-paced teams it often finds itself on. On top of reliably gaining recovery from Wish, Protect has many more applications for Alomomola; it allows Alomomola to scout Choice item users like Walking Wake and Gholdengo, scout for potential double switches by the opponent, gain an extra turn of Leftovers recovery, and stall out an additional turn of burn damage from Scald. A Relaxed nature with 0 Speed IVs ensures that Alomomola is as slow as possible for pivoting effectively. Tera Flying turns Alomomola's weakness to Grass into a resistance, letting it better take on Rillaboom. It also allows Alomomola to avoid Spikes damage if it loses its item to Knock Off, letting it act as a good Knock Off absorber. Tera Dark and Tera Steel are viable alternatives; the former lets Alomomola more capably check Hex Dragapult and the latter giving Alomomola a generally solid defensive typing to aid against Meowscarada and Fairy-types like Enamorus. These also let Alomomola act as a solid absorber of Future Sight from Galarian Slowking. Maximum HP and maximum Defense strengthens Alomomola's monstrous physical bulk, becoming better suited to face the likes of Weavile, Iron Boulder, and Barraskewda. Meanwhile, thanks to Alomomola's astounding HP stat, an EV spread with maximum Defense and Special Defense is also solid, letting Alomomola capably take hits from special attackers such as Hex Dragapult and Choice Specs Enamorus while still possessing solid physical bulk, letting it pivot into a more variety of attackers in general. Rocky Helmet and Red Card can be run over Heavy-Duty Boots; the former further enhances Alomomola's role as a physical wall, letting it switch in and punish Pokemon like Weavile and Meowscarada for Triple Axel while also being able to wear down Kingambit, and the latter allows Alomomola act as a one-time phazer against setup sweepers like Zamazenta, Kingambit, and Dragonite.</p> <p>Alomomola performs best on balance and stall teams due to the sheer value of Wish for teammates that lack reliable recovery. Potent defensive Pokemon such as Ting-Lu, Heatran, and Great Tusk heavily appreciate Alomomola's gargantuan Wish to heal them reliably, as these walls often struggle to recover themselves after chip damage. Similarly, on stall, the likes of Dondozo and Clodsire appreciate Alomomola's Wish help them better deal with chip damage while also letting them preserve Rest and Recover PP, respectively. Additionally, they appreciate Alomomola's effectiveness as a pivot, as it can let them switch in without taking any damage thanks to its relatively low Speed. Special walls such as Blissey, Clodsire, and Skeledirge can cover Alomomola's weaker Special Defense, handling the likes of Iron Valiant and Heatran. Other Pokemon with Regenerator such as Galarian Slowking and Tornadus-T can form potent Regenerator cores, making them difficult to wear down in the face of entry hazards. All of these Pokemon also appreciate Alomomola's capability to take Knock Off rather well. Alomomola is deathly afraid of Ogerpon-W because of Water Absorb. It can easily set up on and decimate Alomomola even after it Terastallizes. Thus, checks to Ogerpon-W such as Rillaboom and Zamazenta make for excellent partners. The former two also appreciate Alomomola's Wish supporting their otherwise shaky longevity. Amoonguss's access to Toxic lets Alomomola have an easier time chipping down and stalling out foes with Flip Turn and Wish, respectively. Offensive Pokemon such as Dragapult, , Meowscarada, and Landorus-T appreciate Alomomola's slow pivoting and ability to pass large Wishes to assist with their longevity.</p>"

      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<p>Alomomola can use Assault Vest to improve its poor Special Defense, becoming a mixed defensive pivot at the expense of Wish. Alomomola can soak up both special and physical moves from Pokemon like Landorus-T, Dragapult, and Iron Moth and pivot out with Flip Turn, with Regenerator recovering most of the damage taken. Scald is Alomomola's best move if it wants to stay in, fishing for burns that help pressure defensive switch-ins like Galarian Slowking, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire and cripple opposing physical attackers like Dragonite, Zamazenta, and Kingambit. Play Rough hits Pokemon that would switch in easily to Scald such as Raging Bolt, Hydrapple, and Walking Wake while chipping down Ogerpon-W decently. Play Rough also helps pressure Calm Mind Iron Valiant, which can otherwise punish Alomomola's Mirror Coat with Encore or repeated use of Calm Mind, and threatens Dark-type special attackers like Darkrai and Greninja that do not fear Mirror Coat at all. Finally, Mirror Coat utilizes Alomomola's high HP stat and the Special Defense from Assault Vest to punish opposing special attackers like Dragapult, and Deoxys-S. A Sassy nature completes the build to Speed tie opposing Alomomola as well as underspeed Hydrapple, Ting-Lu, and Clefable, allowing for Alomomola's teammates to enter safely. Tera Fairy is the primary option to help against rampaging Dragon- and Dark-types like Dragonite, Kingambit, and Roaring Moon while additionally boosting the damage from Play Rough to the point of securing an OHKO against Roaring Moon and a 2HKO against Hisuian Samurott and Iron Valiant. Tera Steel is a secondary option that improves matchups against Calm Mind Iron Valiant and Grass-types like Rillaboom, Meowscarada, and Ogerpon and lets it resist Stealth Rock. Either Tera type can also help against Raging Bolt and Hydrapple, two special attackers that can boost past the threat of Mirror Coat and thus pose a major threat to Alomomola.</p> <p>Assault Vest Alomomola fits best on bulky offense teams that appreciate its ability to tank hits and pivot but do not require the sustained healing from Wish. Strong and fast attackers like Darkrai, Dragapult, and Deoxys-S appreciate Alomomola's ability to provide them with a safe entrance after a slow Flip Turn while at the same time being able to switch in on potential revenge killers like Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Weavile, and Roaring Moon. Offensive pivots like Landorus-T, Raging Bolt, and Cinderace can form a VoltTurn core with Alomomola and appreciate it tanking hits and pivoting on Darkrai and Walking Wake. Physical walls like Zamazenta and Skarmory can benefit from Alomomola handling special attackers like Iron Moth and Dragapult, allowing them to wall or set up on remaining physical threats that can threaten Alomomola such as Rillaboom and Ogerpon-W, the latter of which can even prevent Alomomola from pivoting around freely. Ground-type teammates like Ting-Lu, Gliscor, and Iron Treads are a must to handle foes like Raging Bolt and Zapdos; besides the threat of setup from Calm Mind Raging Bolt, they can also pivot out with Volt Switch, doing big damage and avoiding the answer of Mirror Coat by pivoting to a Dark-type like Kingambit or Ting-Lu. Alomomola is vulnerable to Toxic Spikes, so Poison-types like Iron Moth and Pecharunt can be a good fit. Similarly, Spikes and Stealth Rock can also wear down Alomomola due to the lack of Heavy-Duty Boots, preventing its ability to survive and pivot for longer and ruining the surprise of the Assault Vest. To handle this, teammates like Great Tusk, Corviknight, and Hatterene can help to remove and prevent hazards. Corviknight can also help as a check to Grass-types like Hydrapple and Rillaboom.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Landorus-T acts as important glue on offense teams thanks to its valuable role compression courtesy of its utility options and defensive profile; it functions as a Stealth Rock setter, defensive pivot, and blanket check to the metagame's prominent physical attackers such as Kingambit, Great Tusk, and Zamazenta while chipping them down with Rocky Helmet in the process. Earth Power lets Landorus-T check IronPress Zamazenta and Bulk Up Great Tusk has the added benefit of not being weakened by Rillaboom's Grassy Terrain, but Earthquake can be used instead to hit Galarian Slowking and Calm Mind Raging Bolt hard and makes use of Landorus-T's huge Attack stat in general. Aside from popping Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Heatran's Air Balloons for Landorus-T to threaten them later, U-turn is incredibly vital to bring its teammates in safely, especially because it works incredibly well with Intimidate to soften the blow for an incoming teammate or gain momentum by forcing out the aforementioned physical attackers, all while chipping down switch-ins like Ting-Lu and Rillaboom. Taunt prevents entry hazards from a number of setters like Skarmory, Gliscor, and Glimmora, the last of which Landorus-T can anti-lead well with Earth Power to prevent Toxic Debris activation; stops recovery attempts from walls like Clefable, Dondozo, and Terastallized Garganacl; and limits setup attempts from Zamazenta, Air Balloon Kingambit, Dragonite, and Tera Flying Roaring Moon, with the three capable of using Landorus-T as setup fodder otherwise. Especially for special variants, Taunt can be dropped for a coverage move instead; Psychic lets Landorus-T threaten Hawlucha, 2HKO maximum HP Great Tusk, and hit Zamazenta slightly harder, while Grass Knot is used to 2HKO Dondozo while denting Great Tusk even more. Landorus-T's Tera type is very flexible and mostly depends on what physical threats the team is weak to. Tera Water lets Landorus-T check foes like Barraskewda and Hisuian Samurott more reliably at the cost of making it unable to deal with Raging Bolt and Rillaboom, while Tera Steel improves the matchup against Rillaboom and Meowscarada but makes it unable to check Great Tusk and Zamazenta. Both Tera types also allow Landorus-T to deal with Weavile, with Tera Water being sturdier against Low Kick variants. Tera Grass is another option to check Ogerpon-W while still being great against Hisuian Samurott, Barraskewda, and Rillaboom, though it makes Landorus-T weak to Iron Moth, Cinderace, and U-turn from opposing Landorus-T. Tera Ghost can be used on special sets with Earth Power to let Landorus-T more reliably deal with IronPress Zamazenta—especially because it lacks the necessary Defense investment to repeatedly take on Zamazenta's Body Presses—and additionally prevents spinners like Great Tusk and Iron Treads from removing its Stealth Rock; however, it can no longer switch into Kingambit and Roaring Moon afterwards. A Timid nature is optimal for Earth Power variants, whereas a Jolly nature should be used if running Earthquake.</p> <p>Landorus-T is most effective on offense and bulky offense teams. Any offensive Pokemon generally appreciates the utility it brings to the table, with the likes of Ogerpon-W, Raging Bolt, and Kingambit loving its ability to bring them in safely into the field via U-turn to either set up or wallbreak, especially against Landorus-T's incoming switch-ins; the first two threaten bulky Water-types like Alomomola and Dondozo—with Ogerpon-W dealing with opposing Landorus-T and Gliscor as well—while Raging Bolt pressures Skarmory and Defog Corviknight, preventing Landorus-T's Stealth Rock from being removed. Moreover, their ability to force switches works well with Landorus-T's Stealth Rock, which can be further supported by other offensive threats like Roaring Moon, Iron Valiant, and Rillaboom that can use Knock Off against Heavy-Duty Boots users like Dondozo, Skeledirge, and Dragonite. Iron Valiant in particular can also be handy in covering for IronPress Zamazenta and Bulk Up Great Tusk if Landorus-T lacks Earth Power; other Pokemon like Choice Scarf Enamorus and Will-O-Wisp Dragapult are great options in this regard as well. The aforementioned Kingambit, Raging Bolt, and Rillaboom also appreciate Landorus-T's ability to switch into their offensive checks, namely opposing Landorus-T, Great Tusk, and Zamazenta. In return, some of them possess defensive properties that aid Landorus-T; Ogerpon-W and Primarina can switch into foes like Barraskewda and Walking Wake, while Kingambit and Zamazenta can either handle or soft check Meowscarada and Weavile. IronPress Zamazenta especially appreciates Landorus-T checking Kingambit and Roaring Moon for it to remain healthy and sweep late-game much more easily. Galarian Slowking deserves a special mention as a specially defensive pivot that pairs well with Landorus-T on bulky offense structures; aside from forming a strong VoltTurn core and providing further support for the team in the form of status-spreading and Future Sight, together they form a strong defensive backbone to blanket check all threats in the metagame. Galarian Slowking is adept at switching into and dealing with most special threats, including Iron Valiant and Walking Wake, while Landorus-T handles the likes of Kingambit, Roaring Moon, Great Tusk, and Iron Treads for it in return.</p>"

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>With the combination of its ability, stats, movepool, and typing, Landorus-T is one of the best bulky pivots in the tier. Landorus-T can also be useful against physical threats, chipping them with Rocky Helmet and reducing their damage with Intimidate. Stealth Rock allows it to bring utility to the team, and it can set them up after it comes in on the many Pokemon it checks. It is also able to keep them up either against the Defoggers or the spinners of the tier, depending on if it runs Taunt or Grass Knot, respectively. Earth Power chips key Pokemon like Iron Defense Zamazenta and Great Tusk, but Earthquake can be used as a powerful STAB move in general, hitting hard even if uninvested. U-turn means that Landorus-T can come on the field and check some key Pokemon like Kingambit, Roaring Moon, and non-Ice Spinner Dragonite while also gaining mometum with ease. Taunt can be used to prevent Pokemon like Gliscor and Ting-Lu from putting up entry hazards against it, letting it U-turn after to an ally that can threaten them out. It is also useful to limit setup sweepers like Dragonite and Kingambit, making them easier to revenge kill. Grass Knot is an alternative mostly to hit Great Tusk and Ting-Lu harder while staying on the field. Landorus-T can run an Impish nature with Earthquake and U-turn to do notable damage or go with a Bold nature to not weaken its Earth Power and Grass Knot. A Landorus-T using Taunt will run 36 Speed EVs to outspeed defensive Gliscor, preventing it from setting up Spikes or using Toxic, meaning it can reliably pivot out on Gliscor without its teammates needing to worry about those moves. However, maximum HP and Defense investment can be used to maximize its defensive capabilities. Tera Water is used as an overall great defensive type, letting it turn the tables on Great Tusk's Ice Spinner and Weavile's Triple Axel Fire-type attacks. It synergizes well with its Rocky Helmet by punishing those contact moves hard, particularly weakening Weavile heavily, if it decides to Tera. Tera Steel is also an option, letting it resist Ice-type attacks, notably Ice Beam from Darkrai and Deoxys-S, and to be able to more reliably check Grass-types such as Rillaboom and Meowscarada. It is important to note that Tera Steel leaves it vulnerable to Earthquakes from opposing Landorus-T, as well as Great Tusk. Rocky Helmet in general is useful to punish opposing Landorus-T U-turns, as well as moves from some key Pokemon like Zamazenta.</p> <p>Due to its characteristics, Landorus-T fits on more on offense and bulky offense teams, which love its ability to support its teammates by letting them come on the field safely. It is a good partner for Gholdengo, especially defensive variants, as it appreciates Landorus-T's ability to switch into some of the Dark-types such as Kingambit, Ting-Lu, and Roaring Moon, while Gholdengo forces Skarmory, opposing Air Balloon Gholdengo, and Corviknight to switch out, even preventing a Defog from the latter. Ogerpon-W is also a good choice, as Landorus-T can minimize the damage from Raging Bolt and Rillaboom while chipping them with the Rocky Helmet, U-turns, or its STAB moves. Kingambit is also notable, as it offers a switch-in to Meowscarada's and Weavile's Triple Axel, while Landorus-T can toy with Skarmory and Corviknight with Taunt and beat Zamazenta. Some of the scariest setup Pokemon benefit from Landorus-T's Intimidate to set up, including Kingambit and Ogerpon-W. Landorus-T will struggle to keep itself healthy on more balanced and defensive teams due to the lack of reliable recovery. Alomomola can be a good partner with its Wish while also being able to safely switch into Weavile, Great Tusk, and Barraskewda. Another good partner is Corviknight, which can come in on special Iron Valiant, Enamorus, and Meowscarada more easily while creating a U-turn spam core.</p>"

Water Shuriken provides good priority for Greninja to revenge kill weakened yet faster threats such as Darkrai and Deoxys-S, as well as letting Greninja bypass revenge killing attempts from Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Ice Beam allows Greninja to hit Dragon-type Pokemon such as Roaring Moon and Dragonite and hit Grass-type Pokemon such as Serperior and Rillaboom much harder. Sludge Wave can be used over Ice Beam as an alternative coverage move that can notably 2HKO Assault Vest Primarina after Stealth Rock damage while also having a stronger move to hit Ogerpon-W. Tera Water enhances its Water-type STAB moves and thus improves its cleaning potential. Tera Ghost can be used an alternative Tera type that allows Greninja to bypass Dragonite's Extreme Speed and Zamazenta's Body Press.</p> <p>Greninja fits best on hyper offense and rain teams as an excellent sweeper and cleaner. On hyper offense teams, leads such as Glimmora, Hisuian Samurott, and Deoxys-S can get up entry hazards to help Greninja grab KOs more easily. Dragonite is an excellent teammate for Greninja, as it can deal with Grass-types such as Ogerpon-W and Rillaboom, while Greninja can eliminate physically defensive Pokemon such as Great Tusk and Garganacl for it. Gholdengo is also a good teammate, as it can help check Zamazenta, which is otherwise a dangerous threat that Greninja can let in; in return, Greninja can help check Fire- and Ground-types such as Cinderace and Landorus-T. On rain teams, Pelipper is a prime teammate, as it sets up the rain and helps Greninja get safe switch-ins with U-turn. Barraskewda is an excellent partner that helps Greninja by keeping momentum with Flip Turn and overwhelming shared checks like Primarina and Kyurem. Raging Bolt is a fantastic teammate for Greninja, as it can break bulky Water-type Pokemon such as Primarina and specially defensive Alomomola, and in return, Greninja can eliminate Ground-type Pokemon such as Great Tusk and Iron Treads for Raging Bolt. Iron Treads is a great teammate, since it can reliably clear hazards to keep Greninja healthy as well as check Raging Bolt for Greninja. Rillaboom and Ogerpon-W are also excellent partners for Greninja, threatening special walls such as Primarina and Blissey.</p>"

Thanks to Grassy Seed activating Unburden, Hawlucha becomes faster than the majority of the metagame, outpacing Choice Scarf and Booster Energy users like Darkrai and Iron Valiant and providing plenty of coverage with its Fighting / Flying STAB combination. Its serviceable bulk, along with a boost to its Defense due to Grassy Seed, allows Hawlucha to use Swords Dance in front of many common foes, such as Kingambit and Great Tusk. Encore can force switches and thwart recovery attempts by locking the foe into a resisted attack or a recovery move. Alternatively, Substitute can also give Hawlucha the breathing room it might need to set up against incoming status moves from Gliscor and deny Sucker Punch and Thunderclap from Kingambit and Raging Bolt, respectively. Psychic Seed is an alternative to enable Hawlucha on Psychic Terrain teams, granting it a valuable Special Defense boost that can help it set up in the face of special attackers like Iron Valiant. 124 EVs in Speed are enough to outspeed Sand Rush Excadrill after Unburden activates, and the bulk investment allows it to survive a Make It Rain from Gholdengo from full HP. Either Tera Flying or Tera Fighting are great ways to enhance its damage output; after a Swords Dance, Hawlucha can OHKO Zamazenta through Dauntless Shield with Tera Flying and equally steamroll through Raging Bolt in one hit with Tera Fighting. Tera Flying also rids Hawlucha of its Fairy weakness, allowing it to avoid the 2HKO from Clefable's Moonblast. Alternatively, Tera Electric can be used to withstand Raging Bolt and Gholdengo, disallowing paralysis attempts and resisting Thunderclap and Make It Rain, respectively.</p> <p>Whenever Hawlucha opts to run Grassy Seed, Rillaboom is always nearby. Rillaboom's terrain-setting ability and slow U-turn is pivotal in unleashing Hawlucha's onslaught. It can additionally spread Knock Off to rid Skarmory and Corviknight of their Rocky Helmet, for instance. Strong partners on Grassy Terrain teams include Pokemon such as Iron Moth and Heatran that can help to pressure some of Hawlucha's checks prior to its sweep such as the aforementioned Skarmory and Corviknight. Entry hazard support in the form of Glimmora, Hisuian Samurott, or Ting-Lu is also much appreciated. Hawlucha faces two big roadblocks in Gholdengo and Raging Bolt. Gholdengo in particular can easily shrug off Acrobatics and Close Combat, and it can take out Hawlucha while keeping itself healthy with Recover. Kingambit or the aforementioned Heatran have positive matchups against Gholdengo, while Pokemon like Hatterene can force Gholdengo in and weaken it while also providing a faster-paced Terrain team with entry hazard control. Raging Bolt, on the other hand, threatens non-Tera Electric Hawlucha with Thunderbolt and Thunderclap. It is therefore important to pair it with partners that can neutralize Raging Bolt such as Iron Valiant and Primarina. Indeedee is used instead of Rillaboom on Psychic Terrain teams. However, this is an inconsistent strategy in a metagame populated by Rillaboom, Roaring Moon, Hisuian Samurott and stall with some matches already lost at team preview, so Rillaboom is generally preferred. Rain teams can also handle Hawlucha, as Barraskewda still outspeeds it in the rain. Raging Bolt is a great check to rain teams that synergizes well with Grassy Terrain and can deal with rain's threats prior to Hawlucha cleaning up late-game.</p>"

Its typing also allows it to function as an offensive Water-type able to threaten Grass-types such as Rillaboom and Ogerpon. Steam Eruption lets Volcanion pressure Pokemon switching in by threatening a burn. Earth Power allows Volcanion to hit Galarian Slowking, Raging Bolt, Water Absorb Clodsire, and opposing Volcanion super effectively. Tera Blast Fairy rounds out its coverage and allows Volcanion to hit Dragon-types such as Dragonite, Roaring Moon, and Dragapult. Alternatively, Sludge Bomb can be used to hit Primarina, Hatterene, and Clefable super effectively as well as OHKO Ogerpon-W. The bulk EVs allow Volcanion to survive +2 Weavile's Knock Off and Life Orb Darkrai's Dark Pulse after Stealth Rock. Taunt can be used instead on Heavy-Duty Boots variants to allow Volcanion to deny recovery attempts from defensive Pokemon such as Alomomola, Blissey, and Dondozo. Fire Spin + Taunt is an option to trap passive foes, particularly walls like Blissey and Alomomola, and rack up significant amounts of passive damage. Tera Ghost can be used alongside both Fire Spin and Taunt to give Volcanion an immunity to Seismic Toss and Body Press from Blissey and Zamazenta, respectively, allowing Volcanion to trap and beat them. Choice Specs lets Volcanion maximize its offensive prowess, most notably letting it guarantee a 2HKO Galarian Slowking and Dragapult with Steam Eruption and Earth Power, respectively. Alternatively, Heavy-Duty Boots can be used over Choice Specs to grant Volcanion an immunity to entry hazards. Tera Ground grants Volcanion an immunity to Electric-type attacks from Pokemon such as Zapdos and Raging Bolt in addition to maximizing the power of Earth Power, allowing it to break through Galarian Slowking more easily.</p> <p>Volcanion fits best on balance and bulky offense teams thanks to it providing teams a powerful wallbreaker. If running Choice Specs, Volcanion can have a tough time trying to get into battle due to it being weak to entry hazards, so pivots such as Zapdos, Galarian Slowking, and Corviknight can all provide safe switch-in opportunities for Volcanion to bypass this. Corviknight can also provide Defog support, allowing it to clear entry hazards for Volcanion to grab opportunities to switch in and wallbreak. In return, Volcanion can threaten Fire-types such as Cinderace, Heatran, and Moltres for Corviknight. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Ting-Lu, Gliscor, and Landorus-T can help Volcanion overwhelm bulkier Pokemon such as Kyurem, Galarian Slowking, and Primarina. Volcanion also appreciates their ability to deal with Electric-types such as Zapdos and Raging Bolt in addition to Landorus-T's ability to pivot Volcanion in with U-turn. In return, Volcanion can handle Water-types such as Alomomola, Primarina, and Ogerpon-W for them while being able to switch in on Fire-types like Moltres and Heatran. Physical wallbreakers such as Weavile, Dragonite, and Kingambit are great partners, as they can handle special walls such as Blissey and Galarian Slowking. Weavile, Dragonite, and Kingambit can all bring strong priority to the table, allowing them to revenge kill faster threats such as Roaring Moon and Darkrai, In return, Volcanion can deal with physical walls such as Corviknight, Skarmory, and non-Terastallized Garganacl for them. Volcanion can get worn down quickly if it's not running Heavy-Duty Boots due to its weakness to Stealth Rock, so entry hazard control from Pokemon such as Cinderace, Great Tusk, and Hatterene can help alleviate this issue. Cinderace can also provide safe switch-in opportunites for Volcanion thanks to U-turn, while Great Tusk can also provide entry hazards for Volcanion; both Cinderace and Great Tusk benefit from Volcanion handling Water-types. Hatterene can also provide Healing Wish support, allowing Volcanion to have a second assault if it gets low on health, while also being able to provide paralysis support against faster Pokemon such as Darkrai and Iron Valiant. In return, Volcanion can check Steel-types such as Corviknight and Gholdengo for Hatterene.</p>"

Surf and Moonblast hit the majority of the metagame for neutral or super effective damage, where Surf hits the Steel- and Fire-types such as Gholdengo and Cinderace that resist Moonblast, and Moonblast hits Dragon-types such as Dragapult that resist Surf. Flip Turn allows Primarina to slow pivot a teammate in after a foe has attacked, and it can also be used on predicted switches to gain momentum. Psychic Noise blocks healing from special walls like Blissey, Clodsire, and Clefable, allowing Primarina to chip them down for itself and its partners. 176 Speed EVs let Primarina outspeed Adamant Kingambit and Ursaluna, while the remaining HP EVs allow Primarina to reach feats such as surviving Protosynthesis Thunderbolt from Raging Bolt, +1 Speed Booster Energy Iron Moth's Sludge Wave, +2 Gliscor's Earthquake, and two Heavy Slams from Zamazenta.

This can be useful against moves like Rillaboom's Grassy Glide and Iron Moth's Sludge Wave. Tera Steel also provides a resistance to Stealth Rock, letting it pivot around more freely. However, Tera Steel negatively affects its matchup into Fire- and Fighting-types like Cinderace and Great Tusk. Tera Grass aids Primarina's matchup into Ogerpon-W and can help it against Raging Bolt in a pinch too; however, do note that Tera Grass still leaves it vulnerable to Galarian Slowking.</p> <p>Assault Vest Primarina is best used on bulky offense teams that appreciate a Pokemon that has both offensive and defensive prowess, generally teams that are particularly weak to special attackers. Landorus-T provides Intimidate and checks the physical attackers that Primarina struggles with like Kingambit and Great Tusk. Great Tusk is another great teammate, as it provides entry hazard removal and checks Galarian Slowking, which tends to threaten Primarina. In return, Primarina can handle threats like Darkrai and Walking Wake. Kingambit and Roaring Moon appreciate support from Primarina who can switch in on and hit Pokemon like Iron Valiant and Zamazenta super effectively with STAB Moonblast. Furthermore, both of these Pokemon help check Galarian Slowking for Primarina, along with resisting Grass-type attacks. Gholdengo appreciates Primarina's ability to check Fire-types like Cinderace and Heatran, as well as Walking Wake. Primarina struggles with Grass-types like Ogerpon-W, Meowscarada, and Rillaboom, so it's essential to have checks to these such as Rillaboom, Cinderace, and Kingambit. Cinderace, aside from resisting Grass-type attacks, can also help with hazard removal with Court Change, allowing Primarina to switch in more often. Dragapult and Cinderace can form a great pivoting core with Primarina, and they can also spread burn in order to help improve Primarina's matchup against physical attackers like Great Tusk.</p>"

      "Offensive Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Primarina is a fierce sweeper that can use its STAB moves, combined with Calm Mind, to muscle through most enemies. Primarina can choose between Surf for perfect accuracy or Hydro Pump for greater power that lets it 2HKO Galarian Slowking at +1. Substitute lets Primarina grab more Calm Mind boosts while slower Pokemon try to cripple Primarina with a status effect, like Toxic from Clodsire, Thunder Wave from Galarian Slowking, or Salt Cure from Garganacl, as well as easing prediction. It can use Psychic Noise to block healing from defensive Pokemon,  including Slack Off from Galarian Slowking, Recover from Clodsire, and Wish from Alomomola, thus making them easier to beat. Encore lets Primarina lock opposing Pokemon into moves they don't care for, which can be especially effective in shutting down Kingambit, forcing switches that can give it more opportunities to boost or attack. As for items, Primarina has good choices as well; its item can be Leftovers to grab more healing, pairing well with Substitute, while Heavy-Duty Boots can be used to avoid taking damage from entry hazards. Custap Berry allows Primarina to get one last attack before fainting, which can be useful in luring in and surprising Pokemon that want to use Primarina as momentum. 176 Speed EVs allow Primarina to outspeed Adamant Kingambit. Tera Steel lets Primarina stay in and tank attacks from Grass-, Poison-, and Steel-types and hit them back hard; examples of these moves include Wood Hammer from Rillaboom, Sludge Wave from Iron Moth, and Make It Rain from Gholdengo. Its biggest claim to fame is being able to resist Galarian Slowking's STAB moves, turning one of its worst matchups into a setup opportunity. Tera Poison does similar to Steel, but it lets Primarina resist Fighting-types, like Iron Valiant and Zamazenta, and absorbing Toxic Spikes is a nice addition as well. Finally, Tera Water lets Primarina deal even more damage, which allows it to achieve some thresholds like having great chances to 2HKO Ting-Lu and going from a 4HKO to a 3HKO against Galarian Slowking, both with an unboosted Surf.</p> <p>This Primarina set excels in hyper offensive structures as an early-game monster thanks to its good damage output and Calm Mind, which allow Primarina to destroy Kingambit, Heatran, Zamazenta, Clodsire, and many others. Kingambit loves the fact that Primarina can beat some of its counters like Skarmory, Corviknight, and Dondozo. Kingambit, in return, can beat Galarian Slowking and Blissey. The same applies to Iron Valiant, which appreciates Primarina's ability to counter Pokemon like Gholdengo and Skeledirge that can otherwise give it trouble. Thanks to Primarina's good matchup against defensive Ground-types like Clodsire and Ting-Lu, Pokemon like Gholdengo and Raging Bolt appreciate the help sweeping late-game. Primarina struggles against Pokemon that can either shut it down fast with super effective moves, like Ogerpon-W and Rillaboom, strong physical offense from the likes of offensive Great Tusk, or sturdy special walls such as Galarian Slowking and Blissey. Primarina loves the support from Landorus-T, which can scare away special walls with Earthquake, absorb Raging Bolt's Electric-type moves, support Primarina with Intimidate, allowing Primarina to take on strong physical offense, gain momentum from U-turn, which Landorus-T can easily obtain from common switch-ins like Gliscor, Alomomola, and Skarmory, and set up entry hazards to nab some good damage thresholds, like greatly improving the chance for Primarina to 2HKO bulky variants of Gholdengo and Kingambit with unboosted Surf. Iron Treads is another Ground-type that Primarina appreciates for its ability to check Galarian Slowking; it also provides Stealth Rock support, as well as Rapid Spin to clear the field of hazards. Another great partner is Rillaboom, since it also scares away the aforementioned Galarian Slowking and Blissey, as well as Great Tusk, and provides Primarina with extra healing from Grassy Surge. Dragapult is also a good teammate for Primarina because of its ability to check Ogerpon-W, spread status that can help Primarina either tank or outspeed opposing Pokemon more easily, and use U-turn to bring Primarina safely into the battle. Darkrai makes a good pairing due to its ability to beat Galarian Slowking and really appreciates Primarina's ability to beat both Clodsire and Iron Valiant. Offensive hazard setters like Glimmora, Hisuian Samurott, and Deoxys-S bring hazard pressure that can help Primarina break through walls more easily. Galarian Slowking provides pivoting with Chilly Reception and offensive pressure with Future Sight.</p>"

      "Bulky Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to a great typing and solid overall bulk, Primarina is one of the most dangerous set up sweepers in OU, capable of checking and setting up on offensive Pokemon like Zamazenta, Weavile, and Walking Wake. Calm Mind makes Primarina able to threaten the opposing team while also making itself harder to KO for potential revenge killers like Iron Valiant and Enamorus. Psychic Noise can be used in combination with Liquid Voice to cripple defensive switch-ins that would be able to beat it one-on-one, such as Dondozo, Unaware Clefable, and Clodsire. Surf is also an option to put more pressure on offensive teams due to it's higher Base Power while being run with Torrent, which can power it up in a pinch. It notably is useful against Gholdengo as well as threatening the 2HKO on bulky Kingambit after a Calm Mind. Substitute prevents Primarina from being affected by status moves such as Thunder Wave from Clefable and Toxic from Clodsire. It also punishes switches that Primarina forces and allows it to scout opposing Pokemon. Substitute is also useful to avoid being revenge killed by Rillaboom and Meowscarada while blocking Trick from Pokemon like Choice Scarf Gholdengo. It is also a safe way to bring Primarina to Torrent range. This EV spread ensures that it outspeeds uninvested Clefable and avoids the 2HKO from Protosynthesis-boosted Choice Specs Walking Wake's Hydro Steam under sun. Both Tera Poison and Steel flip the matchup against Grass-types like Meowscarada, Serperior, and Rillaboom while also turning the tables on Galarian Slowking. With Tera Steel, Primarina resists Gholdengo's Make it Rain and can beat it one-on-one. It can also absorb Galarian Slowking's Future Sight and set up on Hatterene and Clefable. With Tera Poison, Primarina gains a great neutral typing against threats like Iron Moth while preserving its resistance to Fighting-type attacks from Zamazenta and Iron Valiant.</p> <p>Primarina fits best on bulky offense teams that appreciate the natural defensive utility that Primarina brings to the table while also being a threatening sweeper itself. Primarina can support teammates such as Weavile, Rillaboom, and Great Tusk by switching in on Zamazenta, Weavile, and Walking Wake. Rillaboom is particulary good, as Primarina covers threats to it like Cinderace, Dragonite, and Skeledirge while appreciating the extra healing of Grassy Terrain. Great Tusk, Rillaboom, and Weavile can threaten Pokemon that would otherwise be annoying for Primarina, such as Galarian Slowking, Ogerpon-W, and Serperior, respectively. Due to Primarina's lack of reliable recovery, it struggles against entry hazards, especially hazard stacking teams. The aforementioned Great Tusk helps it by removing them with Rapid Spin while also being a switch-in to Kingambit that can threaten a weakened Primarina out. Pokemon like Ogerpon-W, Rillaboom, and Serperior can safely switch into Primarina and threaten it with powerful attacks, forcing it to Terastallize or switch out; Pokemon that can switch in on these threats like Kingambit, Rillaboom, Skarmory, and Corviknight make for great teammates. Kingambit is also a huge help, as it beats one of the most common checks to Primarina in Galarian Slowking while appreciating Primarina's ability to safely switch in and beat Zamazenta, Iron Valiant, and Skarmory.</p>"
      },
      "Heavy-Duty Boots": {
        "description": "<p>Primarina becomes an effective pivot thanks to Heavy-Duty Boots allowing it to avoid entry hazard damage, giving it more opportunities to switch in and pivot. Surf and Moonblast combined hit the entire metagame either neutrally or super effectively, and Flip Turn allows Primarina to pivot out of bad matchups and predicted switch-ins like Galarian Slowking and Assault Vest Rillaboom. Encore can render defensive and setup Pokemon useless, locking them into unfavorable moves, such as Corviknight's Roost, Dondozo's Curse, Kingambit's Swords Dance, and Roaring Moon's Dragon Dance after it has Terastallized. 176 Speed EVs are run to outspeed Adamant Kingambit. Tera Steel allows Primarina to stay in on Galarian Slowking and resist Grass-type moves from Pokemon like Rillaboom and Meowscarada. Tera Ghost lets Primarina more comfortably take on both Zamazenta and Dragonite.</p> <p>Primarina fits best on bulky offense teams that want a pivot with considerable offensive pressure. Kingambit fits nicely with Primarina, since it also excels on those playstyles and beats Primarina's most commonly used check in Galarian Slowking. It appreciates Primarina having good matchups against its most common checks in Great Tusk and Zamazenta. Primarina can support teammates such as Great Tusk, Dragonite, and Rillaboom by being able to temporarily switch into Pokemon like Walking Wake, Weavile, and Cinderace. In return, Great Tusk can remove entry hazards for Primarina in case its Heavy-Duty Boots get removed. Dragonite can break through Primarina checks like Clodsire, Rillaboom, Galarian Slowking, and Ogerpon-W, and Rillaboom can provide Grassy Terrain recovery. Primarina greatly appreciates Darkrai being able to beat Galarian Slowking and Gholdengo, and in return, Primarina is able to take on prominent Darkrai checks like Iron Valiant, Zamazenta, and non-Water Absorb Clodsire. Hisuian Samurott is a great partner for Primarina, since it naturally fits on bulky offense teams because it can punch holes through defensive cores while also stacking hazards, and Primarina supports it by being able to switch into Zamazenta, which would otherwise set up on Hisuian Samurott. On hazard stacking teams, Gholdengo is an amazing partner, since it beats Galarian Slowking while also preventing hazard removal from Great Tusk and Corviknight. Pivots like Landorus-T and Iron Crown are able to form a pivoting core with Primarina on bulky offense teams, synergizing well thanks to their complementary typings, offensive presence to pressure opposing teams, and ability to gain momentum even when faced with bad matchups. Landorus-T is able to switch into Electric-types like Raging Bolt, and Iron Crown is able to switch into Galarian Slowking and Rillaboom's Grassy Glide. Raging Bolt appreciates Primarina as a partner, since it's able to take out all the Ground-types that pester it like Ting-Lu and Clodsire, and in return, Raging Bolt can threaten Pokemon that are able to take Primarina's attacks such as specially defensive Corviknight. Raging Bolt's Thunderclap is also able to revenge kill faster offensive threats like Ogerpon-W and Deoxys-S, making up for the core's lack of Speed and strong priority.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With its combination of power, strong priority, solid bulk, and excellent support through Grassy Terrain, Rillaboom is a premier wallbreaker and revenge killer in OU. Grassy Glide allows Rillaboom to revenge kill faster Pokemon like Iron Boulder, Great Tusk, and Barraskewda while also denying lead Deoxys-S and Hisuian Samurott from getting two turns to set entry hazards. Wood Hammer is an excellent tool for breaking through even resistant Pokemon, being able to 2HKO Raging Bolt and Kingambit after Stealth Rock while OHKOing Dondozo, Great Tusk, and Hatterene. U-turn makes Rillaboom a pivot while also being the strongest option against other Rillaboom, Roaring Moon if lacking Drain Punch, and Hydrapple. Knock Off removes items from Rillaboom's checks, including Dragonite, Skarmory, and Moltres, while also being the best option to hit Gholdengo, Skeledirge, and Galarian Slowking. Drain Punch is an alternative that OHKOes Kingambit and hits Heatran switching in while increasing Rillaboom's longevity. An Adamant nature is preferred for its power boost; however, a Jolly nature can be used to outspeed opposing Adamant Rillaboom and Gholdengo without Choice Scarf at the cost of being unable to always OHKO Pokemon like Dondozo and Galarian Slowking with Wood Hammer and Knock Off. An alternative EV spread of 172 HP / 252 Atk / 84 Spe can be used alongside an Adamant nature to outspeed Gliscor while allowing Rillaboom to survive hits such as Life Orb Deoxys-S's Psycho Boost, Ogerpon-W's +2 Power Whip, and Tornadus-T's Bleakwind Storm; however, it notably worsens Rillaboom's matchup against opposing Rillaboom and Raging Bolt due to being outsped. Tera Grass powers up Rillaboom's Grass-type moves, allowing Grassy Glide to OHKO Darkrai, Ogerpon-W, and Iron Valiant after Stealth Rock and Wood Hammer to OHKO Clefable, Toxapex, and Gliscor after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Bulk Up Great Tusk can take advantage of Grassy Terrain's recovery while removing entry hazards for Rillaboom with Rapid Spin, as Rillaboom is prone to hazard damage. Hawlucha is another one of Rillaboom's biggest beneficiaries, using Grassy Seed and Unburden to become an excellent sweeper with nearly unmatched Speed. In return, Rillaboom breaks open bulky teams for Hawlucha and Great Tusk and removes Rocky Helmet and Heavy-Duty Boots from walls like Skarmory, Corviknight, and Terastallized Dondozo. Bulky Ground-weak Pokemon, including Kingambit, Raging Bolt, and Heatran, appreciate Grassy Terrain nullifying their weakness to Earthquake from Pokemon like Gliscor and Ting-Lu while providing extra passive recovery. Kingambit can form a dual priority core with Rillaboom, notably revenge killing Grass-resistant Pokemon like Dragapult and Gholdengo while any attempts to stall out its Sucker Punch give an extra turn of recovery from Grassy Terrain. Raging Bolt is another excellent priority user and wallbreaker that additionally enjoys Rillaboom's U-turn bringing it on checks like Corviknight, Skarmory, and Moltres. Iron Moth and Heatran can also come in on Rillaboom's checks like Cinderace, Corviknight, and Skarmory. Iron Defense Zamazenta is an excellent teammate, as Rillaboom breaks and overwhelms walls like Dondozo and Skarmory that would get in the way of its sweep, and the extra longevity from Grassy Terrain is amazing to keep Zamazenta healthy, as it lacks any reliable ways to heal outside of Leftovers. Hatterene and Comfey can become potent sweepers when used with Rillaboom, both being able to run Grassy Seed while the extra longevity allows Hatterene to keep hazards off more consistenly with Magic Bounce. Grassy Seed allows Hatterene and Comfey to set up on physical attackers that can no longer 2HKO them like Heavy Slam Zamazenta, Ogerpon-W, and Great Tusk while giving an appreciated boost to their Stored Power. Ursaluna and Rillaboom form a terrifying offensive core, with Rillaboom supporting Ursaluna with Knock Off and Grassy Terrain to nullify Flame Orb's chip damage. Both Tail Glow and Take Heart Manaphy can be used alongside Rillaboom, as the Terrain powers up its Energy Ball and gives extra longevity to set up, become unbreakable, and fire off devastating Stored Powers, respectively. Rillaboom can bypass checks like Dragonite, Zapdos, and Moltres with support from Stealth Rock setters like Heatran, Great Tusk, and Glimmora in addition to its Knock Off to remove their Heavy-Duty Boots.</p>"

      "Utility": {
        "description": "<p>Rillaboom is an excellent Terrain setter, revenge killer, wallbreaker, and offensive pivot all at once thanks to its good Attack stat, Grassy Surge, and access to a phenomenal movepool. Knock Off hits Grass-resistant foes such as Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Galarian Slowking super effectively while also removing items from common switch-ins such as Heavy-Duty Boots from Moltres, Rocky Helmet from Skarmory, and Leftovers from Zamazenta, reducing their effectiveness. U-turn allows Rillaboom to pivot out of bad matchups such as against Dragon-types like Dragonite and Raging Bolt and generate momentum for its team; it also enables Rillaboom to bring its setup sweeper teammates like Hawlucha and Hatterene in. Low Kick hits foes like Kingambit and Heatran for super effective damage. Alternatively, Wood Hammer can be used as a stronger STAB move, OHKOing offensive Great Tusk and 2HKOing defensive variants, 2HKOing Hatterene, and having a roll to OHKO Ting-Lu. 52 Speed EVs allow Rillaboom to outspeed Jolly Kingambit. Alternatively, a spread of 172 HP / 252 Atk / 84 Spe can be run for Rillaboom to outspeed Gliscor. With Tera Grass, Rillaboom 2HKOes Iron Valiant with Grassy Glide and Gliscor with Wood Hammer after Poison Heal. Otherwise, Tera Fighting can be used to make Rillaboom resistant to Dark-type moves such as Sucker Punch from Kingambit. Terrain Extender helps teammates like Hawlucha to find more opportunities to come in; however, Assault Vest can be used instead to allow Rillaboom to better check special attackers such as Primarina and Gholdengo.</p> <p>Rillaboom shines on offense teams and is a staple on Grassy Terrain-based teams. Terrain Extender should usually be used on hyper offense teams and provides wonderful support to its setup sweeper partners. Assault Vest has overall better defensive utility and thus should generally be used on bulky offense teams; it is exceptional at supporting bulkier threats such as Zamazenta, helping them deal with foes like Primarina and Gholdengo. Although generally the best fits, these recommendations are not set in stone, and either item can be used on either archetype, with Assault Vest potentially providing hyper offense with a one-time check to a special threat and Terrain Extender supporting bulky offense. Hawlucha proves itself to be an exceptional partner for Rillaboom; In Grassy Terrain, it can utilize Grassy Seed to transform into a terrifying cleaner with Swords Dance and Unburden. Hatterene also functions as a remarkable Calm Mind cleaner with Grassy Seed and longevity from Grassy Terrain. Similarly, Primarina appreciates the longevity Grassy Terrain provides to turn itself into a dangerous threat with Calm Mind; moreover, it synergizes well with Rillaboom by helping it against Fire-types such as Moltres. Setup sweepers such as Roaring Moon and Raging Bolt also appreciate Grassy Terrain's passive recovery and pivoting from Rillaboom. Other teammates that benefit from the same include Pokemon weak to Earthquake from foes like Ting-Lu and Gliscor, such as Gholdengo, Kingambit, and the aforementioned Raging Bolt. Rillaboom is vulnerable to Fire-types like Moltres, Cinderace, and Iron Moth so teammates such as Heatran, Roaring Moon, and Great Tusk are appreciated. Rillaboom also likes entry hazards to chip its foes; thus, the aforementioned Heatran and Glimmora make perfect partners. Rillaboom is forced out by threats like Dragonite, Skarmory, Corviknight, and Tera Flying Roaring Moon because it's unable to significantly damage them, so partners such as Dragapult and the previously mentioned Raging Bolt should be acknowledged. Dragon-types like Dragapult and Raging Bolt can also give Rillaboom a hard time due to them being resistant to its Grassy Glide, so Pokemon like Iron Valiant and Kingambit make great partners. As a Terrain setter, Rillaboom and its teammates can face difficulty in facing Ice Spinner users like Great Tusk and Iron Treads; as such, it is important to position setup sweepers as soon as possible while also packing checks such as the aforementioned Hatterene for Great Tusk and Zamazenta for Iron Treads. Hatterene is also very useful at keeping entry hazards off the field, which is appreciated by Rillaboom and its teammates. Additional hazard removers such as the previously mentioned Great Tusk also make great partners. Zamazenta is also a wonderful partner that proves itself to be a threatening IronPress user with Grassy Terrain solving its problem with longevity. Comfey can also take advantage of Grassy Seed's Defense boost and Grassy Terrain's passive recovery to set up with Calm Mind and dismantle unprepared teams. Serperior is also an excellent teammate and greatly benefits from Grassy Terrain boosting its Leaf Storm, notably allowing it to KO offensive Gholdengo over two turns.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With its high Attack and Speed stats, coupled with Libero, Heavy-Duty Boots, U-turn, and a strong Fire-type attack in Pyro Ball, Cinderace is a great offensive pivot. Sucker Punch gives Cinderace priority and allows it to revenge kill faster threats such as Dragapult, Deoxys-S, weakened Iron Moth, and Terastallized Roaring Moon. Court Change offers great entry hazard control, getting rid of hazards against even Gholdengo and removing Alolan Ninetales's Aurora Veil in addition. Alternatively, High Jump Kick and Gunk Shot can be run as coverage options. The former OHKOes Roaring Moon and Hisuian Samurott as well as hitting non-Terastallized Garganacl for super effective damage. The latter can OHKO Ogerpon-W and deal with Fairy-types like Primarina, Hatterene, and Clefable, as well as having a good chance of poisoning switch-ins. With Tera Fire, Cinderace regains its original typing after a Libero type change, allowing it to OHKO unboosted Kingambit, defensive Gholdengo, and Iron Treads as well as 2HKO Hatterene and Clefable with Pyro Ball. However, after Terastallizing, Cinderace won't benefit from Libero anymore.</p> <p>Offensive Pivot Cinderace is a great option on bulky offense teams. Landorus-T and Galarian Slowking synergize well with Cinderace, as Landorus-T can check Great Tusk and Zamazenta, which are problematic for Cinderace, while Galarian Slowking can switch into strong special attackers such as Raging Bolt and Primarina along with helping to check Zamazenta. Furthermore Grass-type Pokemon like Rillaboom, Serperior, and Ogerpon-W can also help Cinderace, as they can handle Water- and Ground-type Pokemon such as Primarina, Hisuian Samurott, Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Gliscor. Cinderace can bring these teammates in with U-turn. Rillaboom and Ogerpon-W are particularly helpful, as the former sets the Grassy Terrain that provides Cinderace with passive recovery and weakens Earthquake to let it stay in on Pokemon like Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and Iron Treads, while the latter completely absorbs Water-type moves as well as benefiting from Cinderace’s ability to hit Grass-types and taking advantage of the hazard control it offers. Finally, Zamazenta also threatens Cinderace, so Pokemon such as Iron Valiant, Gholdengo, and Enamorus can be helpful, and they can benefit from Cinderace's presence, as it can bring them in safely and remove entry hazards for them.</p>"

      "Bulky Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>Cinderace's bulky set revolves around the idea of maximizing its utility. U-turn keeps up momentum for its teammates and helps it to pivot out of bad matchups. Will-O-Wisp allows it to cripple physically offensive Pokemon like Kingambit, Great Tusk, and Dragonite. Court Change enables it to function as an entry hazard remover and one of the best answers to Sticky Web and dual screens teams. Heavy-Duty Boots is the best item for Cinderace, allowing it to spread status and remove hazards effectively. The set's EVs allow it to OHKO offensive Gholdengo with Pyro Ball. Blaze is the preferred ability to keep Cinderace's Fire-type defensive profile intact after using Court Change, maintaining a resistance to moves like Moonblast from Iron Valiant, Make It Rain from Gholdengo, and Grassy Glide from Rillaboom. Blaze also lets Cinderace keep its Fire STAB after using Court Change. Tera Fire provides a much-appreciated boost to Cinderace's Pyro Ball, while Tera Flying allows it to land a potential burn or get a free Court Change on Ground-types like Great Tusk and Ting-Lu.</p> <p>Cinderace works best on bulky offense and balance teams, where it can support its team while keeping up offensive momentum. For example, Ogerpon-W loves having a partner that can remove hazards, and it can, in return, threaten Cinderace's checks like Landorus-T and Gliscor. Corviknight likes partnering with Cinderace because both of them can remove hazards, and Cinderace can force out Gholdengo. Dragapult appreciates Cinderace's ability to spread burns so that it can threaten foes with Hex. Landorus-T works well with Cinderace as a bulky Intimidate pivot, giving another layer of safety against physical attackers like Roaring Moon and Kingambit. Alomomola can also help to check and pivot around physical attackers, as well as providing Wish support to keep Cinderace healthy in longer battles. Pokemon like Gliscor and Heatran take little damage from Pyro Ball and are immune to Will-O-Wisp, and so Great Tusk makes a great Cinderace partner which can threaten them out while serving as another form of hazard removal. Primarina can also threaten Gliscor and Heatran, as well as handling Pokemon Cinderace cannot, such as Clodsire and Dondozo. Water-types that are not scared of Cinderace's Will-O-Wisp are also natural Cinderace answers, like Walking Wake and the aforementioned Primarina. Grass-types like Ogerpon-W, Ogerpon, and Rillaboom provide safety versus Primarina, and Rillaboom in particular has Grassy Terrain to negate Cinderace's weakness to Earthquake. Fairy-types like Iron Valiant, Enamorus, and Hatterene are always great options for not just Walking Wake, but also for the other Dragon-types in the tier that resist Cinderace's Pyro Ball and don't fear a burn like Raging Bolt. Both Iron Valiant and Enamorus appreciate Cinderace's U-turn to bring them in safely, and Hatterene appreciates having Cinderace as insurance to help with hazard control. Galarian Slowking is a good partner for Cinderace due to its ability to pivot with Chilly Reception, creating a strong defensive pivoting core; Galarian Slowking is also able to check special attackers like Walking Wake, while Cinderace returns the favor by checking physical attackers like Kingambit.</p>"

Its great typing, access to Roost, immunity to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, and neutrality to Stealth Rock allow it to stave off a number of key threats such as Meowscarada, Kingambit, and Iron Defense Zamazenta while granting its teammates safe switch-ins with its slow U-turn. Body Press is the primary attacking move, allowing Corviknight to deal high damage to Pokemon such as Kingambit, Roaring Moon, and Hisuian Samurott. U-turn allows Corviknight to pivot out of stalemates and bad matchups. It is particularly useful against Gliscor and Gholdengo, as Gliscor will be unable to cripple Corviknight's partner with Knock Off or Toxic, while Gholdengo will be unable to exploit Corviknight and its Air Balloon will be popped, allowing Corviknight's teammates such as Great Tusk to more easily make progress against it. Iron Defense powers up Body Press and allows Corviknight to more reliably check Pokemon such as Kingambit and Iron Defense Zamazenta lacking Roar. Brave Bird is another option to more reliably make progress against Tera Ghost Pokemon and deal high damage to Iron Valiant, Ogerpon-W, and Rillaboom. Defog is another option, as it allows Corviknight to clear entry hazards against non-Gholdengo teams. Thanks to Pressure, Corviknight can PP stall certain entry hazard setters such as Gliscor and Clefable, with it effectively having higher Defog PP than Stealth Rock or Spikes and making it effective at removing entry hazards against bulkier teams. Leftovers allows Corviknight to continuously stay healthy and recover from potential Stealth Rock chip damage, which will wear it down over time. Alternatively, Rocky Helmet lets Corviknight punish key physical attackers such as Meowscarada, Weavile, and Kingambit. 120 Speed EVs can be used to outspeed Adamant Kingambit and either set up Iron Defense or attack it with Body Press. However, Corviknight loses a considerable amount of bulk and its slow U-turn, which can be detrimental when pivoting to one of its teammates. Corviknight is a poor Terastallization candidate due to it losing its near-complete immunity to entry hazards. Nonetheless, it can use Tera to secure an endgame sweep with Iron Defense and Body Press or emergency check certain threats. Tera Water improves Corviknight's matchup against Fire-types such as Cinderace and Heatran, as well as Weavile. Tera Fighting lets Corviknight check Kingambit better and powers up its Body Press. Tera Grass or Tera Dragon can also be used to improve Corviknight's matchup against Ogerpon-W.</p> <p>Corviknight best fits on balance and stall teams looking for a defensive pivot and Knock Off absorber. Wallbreakers such as Meowscarada, Dragapult, and Weavile all pair well with Corviknight, as it can safely bring them in with its slow U-turn. All of the aforementioned partners are notably able to make progress against Gliscor, which Corviknight itself has trouble doing. Meowscarada and Weavile in particular are great partners, as they can also remove Rocky Helmet from opposing Corviknight, Skarmory, and Landorus-T, which can otherwise wear down Corviknight as it goes for one of its attacking moves. Special walls such as Galarian Slowking, Blissey, and Clodsire appreciate Corviknight's ability to handle physical attackers such as Kingambit, Great Tusk, and Hisuian Samurott. In turn, they can handle the many special attackers that can threaten Corviknight such as Gholdengo and Walking Wake. Corviknight can struggle with being worn down over time by Stealth Rock chip damage, losing its Leftovers to Knock Off, and Taunt preventing it from using Roost. Corviknight also struggles to make progress against certain threats that can switch in on it freely, such as Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Moltres. Gholdengo is a particularly annoying matchup for Corviknight, as it also prevents it from using Defog due to Good as Gold. Alomomola can keep Corviknight healthy with Wish and pivot into Fire-type attacks. Tera Water Garganacl and Ting-Lu are good checks to Gholdengo and Dragapult, and they appreciate Corviknight's ability to keep entry hazards off the field. Kingambit is also a good partner, as it does an adequate job at checking Gholdengo and Dragapult while also punishing opposing Tera Ghost Kingambit, which could otherwise set up on Corviknight. Heatran is another difficult matchup for Corviknight, as it can safely set up Stealth Rock against Corviknight while threatening it with Magma Storm. Partners that can deal with Heatran, such as Gliscor or the aforementioned Ting-Lu and Alomomola, are thus recommended.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Leveraging high Attack and Swift Swim to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame—and most of the boosted metagame—Barraskewda is one of OU's most terrifying wallbreakers under rain. Choice Band Liquidation in rain tears through almost everything, OHKOing Galarian Slowking, Garganacl, and physically defensive Great Tusk. Flip Turn allows Barraskewda to quickly switch out against threatening Pokemon like Dragapult and bring in teammates that can better handle them or get valuable chip damage on foes it can't OHKO, while Aqua Jet gives it the opportunity to act as a revenge killer even without rain to boost its Speed or potentially beat Kingambit with faster priority. Close Combat threatens to OHKO a number of Water-resistant foes, like Roaring Moon, Kyurem, and Hisuian Samurott, and hits Ogerpon-W. Tera Water is often used to further augment Barraskewda's already strong offensive presence, it and rain letting Barraskewda OHKO Hatterene, Dragapult, and Latias with Liquidation and Gliscor, Ting-Lu, and offensive Landorus-T and offensive Gholdengo variants with Flip Turn. However, a defensive Tera Type in Ghost is also an option; it prevents Barraskewda from being revenge killed by Dragonite's Extreme Speed while removing its weakness against priority attacks from unboosted Raging Bolt and Rillaboom.</p> <p>Because Barraskewda should only be used on rain teams, it must be paired with Pelipper, where it takes advantage of both the rain Pelipper sets and Pelipper's ability to safely pivot it in with U-turn. Due to its below-average defensive stats, Barraskewda is susceptible to being revenge killed by Rillaboom and Raging Bolt, so defensive teammates like Iron Treads are needed to switch into these Pokemon. Barraskewda also struggles against bulky Water-types like Dondozo, Ogerpon-W, and Tera Water Garganacl, as well as being completely walled by Water Absorb Clodsire; it partners well with Raging Bolt, Rillaboom, and Ogerpon-W, which can remove them, though Barraskewda does beat Clodsire if it's running an Unaware set. Barraskewda appreciates entry hazard removal and setting from Iron Treads, the former allowing it to not get worn down through repeated pivots, as it lacks recovery, as well as helping keep Pelipper healthy for sustained rain setting, and the latter allowing it to OHKO physically defensive Corviknight and Skarmory with Tera Water Liquidation in rain after Stealth Rock damage. Kingambit pairs well with Barraskewda, since it can easily revenge kill Pokemon that Barraskewda has already significantly weakened.</p>"

      "Shell Smash": {
        "description": "<p>Uniquely among setup sweepers, Shell Smash + Stored Power gives Polteageist the power to KO most of the tier, the Speed to outspeed most of it, and a tool to plow through Unaware walls, all in one turn. Its Ghost typing also blocks common priority attacks like Dragonite's Extreme Speed and Breloom's Mach Punch, which allows it to sweep even when Psychic Terrain is not active. Though it is resisted by Steel-types, a Psychic Terrain-boosted Stored Power can still heavily damage even Corviknight, 2HKOing physically defensive variants after just one Shell Smash. Shadow Ball is a consistent STAB move with excellent neutral coverage to hit most Steel- and Psychic-types hard, OHKOing Gholdengo and Hatterene. Tera Blast with Tera Fighting fills a gap in Polteageist's coverage, eliminating Dark-types like Roaring Moon, Kingambit while Psychic Terrain is active, and Hydreigon. Tera Fighting can also let it survive their Dark-type attacks. Weak Armor alongside a Focus Sash allows Polteageist to punish a stray physical attack, further boosting its Speed—it can outspeed +1 foes like Roaring Moon, Iron Valiant, and Iron Moth—and Stored Power's damage. Focus Sash also lets Polteageist set up against threats that would otherwise outpace it or survive an attack and OHKO it, such as Kingambit, Choice Specs Dragapult, and offensive Great Tusk. A Timid nature is run to outpace +1 Walking Wake after a single Shell Smash.</p> <p>Polteageist is a staple on Psychic Terrain offense teams. Indeedee's Psychic Terrain protects Polteageist against priority attacks from Kingambit, Azumarill, and Floatzel while powering up its Stored Power, though Polteageist requires both a Shell Smash and a Weak Armor boost to outpace Swift Swim Floatzel. Indeedee can also let Polteageist set up with Encore or give it a second chance to sweep with Healing Wish, although if Polteageist has already consumed its Focus Sash, it will struggle to set up as reliably a second time. Armarouge is an excellent teammate and another staple on Psychic Terrain teams, as it can eliminate Steel-types like Kingambit with Armor Cannon to enable Polteageist's late-game sweep and it can use Endure to activate Weak Armor multiple times against Dragon Darts Dragapult, which Polteageist cannot reliably set up against. In return, Polteageist can greatly weaken or outright eliminate Unaware walls, set up against specially offensive Dragapult if its Focus Sash is intact, and can safely utilize Tera Fighting to eliminate Roaring Moon and wear down Ting-Lu, which allows Armarouge to sweep. Entry hazard removal is extremely important to maintain Focus Sash's protection. Eject Pack Great Tusk provides both Rapid Spin and Stealth Rock support, can safely get Polteageist in after using a strong Headlong Rush or Close Combat, and can also switch into and threaten Dark-types for Polteageist. Magic Bounce Hatterene deters entry hazards, spreads paralysis with Nuzzle, and can provide Healing Wish support. Also, Eject Button lets it safely pivot Polteageist in, even against U-Turns from Corviknight, Cinderace, or Meowscarada, giving it much easier setup opportunities. Setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Dragapult appreciate Polteageist breaking past Unaware walls and wearing down Steel-types. In return, Dragapult can use its multi-hit attacks to threaten opposing Psychic Terrain teams.</p>"

    "sets": {
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>With entry hazard control provided by Magic Bounce, solid defensive stats that combine with powerful offenses to grant it great matchups against Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Clefable, and the potential for it to set up and snowball out of control with Calm Mind while keeping itself healthy with Draining Kiss, Hatterene makes a great addition to offensive teams looking for a special sweeper and hazard control in one. Psyshock is a strong STAB option that allows for Hatterene to target specially defensive walls on their weaker side, allowing for it to break through Blissey, Galarian Slowking, and Clodsire while dealing with opposing setup sweepers that boost their Special Defense such as Tera Fairy Raging Bolt. Stored Power lacks the immediate power of Psyshock but can scale heavily with multiple Calm Minds to allow Hatterene to muscle past even Unaware targets like Skeledirge, Clodsire, and Dondozo, along with also helping to win the one-on-one against other special setup sweepers in a similar manner to Psyshock. Unfortunately, its STAB combination leaves Hatterene walled by common Steel-types like Gholdengo, Heatran, and Iron Treads, while the low base power of Draining Kiss allows for Kingambit to easily stomach a boosted hit. Mystical Fire is a great coverage option that targets Steel-types, in particular helping to weaken Gholdengo's attacks, although this leaves Hatterene unable to hit Heatran; Nuzzle can alternatively be used to spread paralysis onto common switch-ins like Kingambit, Gholdengo, Heatran, and Skeledirge. While Magic Bounce's primary utility comes from its ability to deny entry hazards, it also blocks disruptive moves like Encore from Iron Valiant and Ogerpon-W and Taunt from Landorus-T and Heatran, along with status moves like Toxic from Gliscor and Clodsire; this makes it far more potent as a setup sweeper. Leftovers is Hatterene's best option to greatly improve its staying power along with allowing it to switch in multiple times over the course of a game to block hazards; on Grassy Terrain teams and particularly with Stored Power, Grassy Seed can be considered to give Hatterene a better chance at immediately sweeping at the expense of being worse at coming in repeatedly, though Leftovers is still a viable option on these builds. The given spread runs enough Speed EVs to outspeed Toxapex, allowing for Hatterene to use a boosted attack before Toxapex can remove its boosts with Haze, with the remaining EVs invested to maximize physical defense. This notably allows for Hatterene to live even a +1 Protosynthesis-boosted Knock Off from Roaring Moon, while also dodging the 2HKO from Cinderace's Pyro Ball. An alternative spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with a Bold nature can be considered on Nuzzle variants of Hatterene, as the Speed is less necessary when it is able to paralyze foes and so more physical bulk can be invested; however, this notably makes Hatterene slower than offensive Kingambit even after paralysis. Tera Water is a great neutral defensive typing that grants Hatterene a resistance to Steel-type attacks from Kingambit and Gholdengo, along with allowing it to stay in on Water- and Fire-type attacks from Pokemon that now struggle to eliminate it like Dondozo and Iron Moth. Tera Fire also gives Hatterene a better matchup into Kingambit and Gholdengo while also giving it resistances to attacks from Rillaboom and powering up its coverage option on Mystical Fire sets. However, this comes at the expense of a weakness to Ground-type attacks from Great Tusk and Gliscor, along with making Hatterene much easier to revenge kill with strong Water-types like Ogerpon-W and Walking Wake.</p> <p>Calm Mind Hatterene is a great pick on offense teams that appreciate the support against entry hazards, particularly for bulkier offense builds without a dedicated hazard setting lead. One particular form of bulky offense that Hatterene thrives on is Grassy Terrain with Rillaboom, with the additional passive recovery from the Terrain being much appreciated to help boost Hatterene's longevity further. In return, Hatterene can keep hazards clear from the field, allowing for teammates like Heatran, Raging Bolt, and Rillaboom itself to opt not to run Heavy-Duty Boots without fearing hazard damage racking up over time. Hatterene fits on far more than Terrain offense though, finding a home on even hyper offense teams alongside hazard setters like Glimmora, and some of its best partners on both bulky offense and hyper offense are offensive hazard-weak Pokemon that would sooner run a boosting item than Heavy-Duty Boots; prime examples of this are Raging Bolt and Roaring Moon. Though Hatterene has ways of dealing with some of its more problematic matchups, Kingambit and Gholdengo are always an issue for their ability to shrug off its STAB attacks and threaten it with their own; bulky, offensive switch-ins to the former like Great Tusk and Zamazenta can alleviate this issue without dropping offensive pressure, while Kingambit itself can make a strong partner for its ability to come in on Gholdengo along with other Ghost- and Poison-type moves from foes like Dragapult and Galarian Slowking, the latter of which being one of Hatterene's most prevalent checks with its high Special Defense and resistance to Draining Kiss. In return for Kingambit's positive matchups against these targets, Hatterene resists Fighting-type attacks from Great Tusk, Skarmory, and Iron Valiant that would typically be directed towards Kingambit. One Pokemon that Hatterene struggles to break through is Heatran, as it takes negligible damage from even a boosted Draining Kiss and can negate Hatterene's Leftovers recovery with Magma Storm's passive damage; If Hatterene has Tera available and has already boosted with multiple Calm Minds as Heatran enters the field, the matchup swings in Hatterene's favour, but Hatterene is notably unable to come in directly on Heatran to prevent it from setting up Stealth Rock. Offensive partners like Hisuian Samurott and Zamazenta can be used as switch-ins to Magma Storm, able to threaten the opposing Heatran out and with the latter appreciating Hatterene's ability to bait Heatran in and pop a potential Air Balloon. Although Hatterene is usually sufficient in keeping hazards off of its side of the field, on top of the aforementioned Stealth Rock Heatran matchup, opposing Hisuian Samurott are able to put hazards up with Ceaseless Edge despite losing to Hatterene itself. This makes alternative forms of hazard removal such as Great Tusk and Iron Treads good partners to Hatterene, as they can provide key relief in these matchups for hazard-weak teams that would otherwise be overly reliant on Hatterene.</p>"
      },
      "Healing Wish": {
        "description": "<p>Through a coveted combination of Healing Wish, an elite ability in Magic Bounce, reasonably strong STAB moves, a typing that naturally checks Fighting-types, and a choice of Nuzzle to effortlessly spread paralysis or Mystical Fire to check special attackers and punish Steel-types, Hatterene can support its teammates in a way that cannot be fully replicated by anything else. Healing Wish is crucial, as it allows Hatterene to sacrifice itself in order to fully heal a teammate's HP and cure any status effects; because Hatterene is often paired with sweepers and Terrain or weather setters that enable them, this is often a perfectly acceptable trade to pivot them in safely. Psychic and Dazzling Gleam boast decent coverage together and greatly threaten Fighting-types like Great Tusk and Zamazenta thanks to Hatterene's high base Special Attack; Psychic leaves its mark against Poison-types like Glimmora and Toxapex, while Dazzling Gleam hits Dragon-types like Roaring Moon, Raging Bolt, and Dragapult and Dark-types like Darkrai. Nuzzle ensures that Hatterene remains far from passive by paralyzing anything bar Ground-types and Electric-types; even Gholdengo and opposing Hatterene, which are safe from paralysis from Thunder Wave, are crippled if hit by Nuzzle. Mystical Fire, however, complements Hatterene's STAB moves well by hitting Steel-types super effectively; it also always lowers the opponent's Special Attack, giving it some added utility against threats that can boost their Special Attack like Calm Mind Raging Bolt. Eject Button complements Magic Bounce perfectly; Hatterene's mere presence on a team will deter opponents from setting entry hazards and using status moves, and with significant investment, Hatterene's bulk is sufficient enough to switch directly into a strong neutral hit, survive, and activate Eject Button to safely pivot a teammate in. Eject Button also has the added benefit of turning the tables on U-turn and Volt Switch users, getting a free switch while denying their own switch. 132 Speed EVs allow Hatterene to outpace Ting-Lu, ensuring that it can at least get some chip damage against it before being attacked in return and expanding the number of slower threats it can use Healing Wish against before being KOed. The rest of its EVs serve to maximize its physical bulk, allowing Hatterene to better pivot in against most physical attackers such as unboosted Kingambit and Roaring Moon, Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Meowscarada. Tera Steel allows Hatterene to handle Fairy-type attacks from Iron Valiant and Enamorus more easily so it can punish them with Nuzzle and turns Hatterene's Poison weakness into an immunity, allowing it to spinblock against Mortal Spin Glimmora. Steel's powerful defensive profile also expands the number of threats Hatterene can safely use Healing Wish against in a pinch, such as Iron Head Kingambit and Galarian Slowking; though very situational, other Tera types like Dark and Flying can accomplish similar goals against different threats like Gholdengo and Dragapult for the former and Great Tusk and Heavy Slam Zamazenta for the latter.</p> <p>Healing Wish Hatterene's ability to enable multiple free switches for its teammates makes it a strong choice for offensive teams—particularly teams vulnerable to entry hazards—that need to maximize a limited number of turns. Healing Wish Hatterene is almost mandatory on sun teams, which are often so vulnerable to hazards that its Magic Bounce serves as a strong secondary or even tertiary countermeasure against them; Fire-types such as Torkoal and Ninetales are especially weak to entry hazards, but even powerful attackers like Choice Band Roaring Moon, Choice Specs Walking Wake, Black Glasses and Air Balloon Kingambit, and Life Orb Venusaur and Hisuian Lilligant can be worn down very quickly with hazard chip. Many of these are also answers to traditional Hatterene checks; powerful offensive threats like Choice Specs Walking Wake, Choice Band Roaring Moon, and offensive Great Tusk can collectively overwhelm Hatterene checks like Gholdengo, Galarian Slowking, and Heatran, which gives Hatterene plenty of opportunities to switch in on a neutral attack and either pivot out with Eject Button or use Healing Wish. Sun teams also greatly appreciate Hatterene's ability to give Torkoal an extra chance to support its team with Drought through Healing Wish, further enable these aforementioned offensive threats with Healing Wish, or spread paralysis with Nuzzle. Hatterene is also useful on rain teams for similar reasons; Pelipper greatly appreciates extra opportunities to set Drizzle up through Eject Button or Healing Wish, and teammates like Barraskewda and Raging Bolt appreciate both Hatterene's ability to deny hazards to keep them healthy and the many safe switches it can enable. Hatterene is also a staple on Psychic Terrain teams, which appreciate its ability to give Indeedee an extra chance to set up Psychic Terrain or to safely pivot in sweepers like Shell Smash Polteageist, Dragon Dance Roaring Moon, offensive Deoxys-S, and Booster Energy Iron Boulder and Iron Crown while wasting as few precious Psychic Terrain turns as possible.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Dragapult is one of OU's best pivots, with its massive base Speed stat allowing it to dance around slower threats, spread status and deal significant damage over the course of a game. Dragon Darts is a strong STAB option that hits key targets in the tier such as Roaring Moon, Raging Bolt, and Dragonite. Alternatively, Draco Meteor can be used with an EV spread fully invested into Special Attack that lets it secure an OHKO into Walking Wake while also giving Dragapult a more powerful Hex to 2HKO even max HP Gholdengo, but the Special Attack drop from Draco Meteor leaves it vulnerable to being used as setup fodder, and this set is also weaker into sweepers that boost their Special Defense such as Raging Bolt. Both Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave are great options that synergize with the rest of Dragapult's toolkit by doubling the power of Hex; Will-O-Wisp turns Dragapult into a great fast check that can outrun and neutralize physical threats such as Zamazenta, Great Tusk, and Kingambit while also forcing chip on Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Clodsire that try to switch in, while Thunder Wave cripples burn-immune targets like Clefable and Cinderace and slows down special attackers like Darkrai, Iron Moth, and Iron Valiant to help teammates deal with them more easily. Tera Fairy is a great defensive option that flips Dragapult's Dragon weakness into an immunity while also granting a Dark resistance to resist hits from Kingambit and Darkrai, whereas Tera Ghost powers up Hex while still dropping its weaknesses to Fairy and Dragon to help block revenge killing attempts by Enamorus. The Attack EVs allow Dragapult to OHKO Roaring Moon and 2HKO Hisuian Samurott with Dragon Darts from full health.</p> <p>Heavy-Duty Boots Dragapult is a fantastic pick on balance teams, synergizing well with durable hazard setters such as Gliscor, Skarmory, and Ting-Lu that can assist in chipping down the switch-ins that it forces. In return, Dragapult helps to patch up bulkier teams' lack of speed control while not minding the hazards that they often allow on both sides of the field. Knock Off users such as Weavile and Meowscarada are solid pairings with Dragapult on these balance structures, removing Heavy-Duty Boots from opposing Pokemon to make the switches that Dragapult forces more meaningful while giving Dragapult opportunities to come in for free on their own checks, allowing these teams to better pressure opposing Skarmory and Corviknight. Bulkier offense teams also benefit from the presence of Dragapult as a form of speed control that wears down defensive cores with both damage and status effects; Kingambit in particular is a terrifying late-game sweeper that appreciates Dragapult's ability to weaken a team for it to clean through, with Will-O-Wisp Dragapult able to neuter its physical checks like Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Skarmory, while Thunder Wave variants can slow down threats that would otherwise outspeed Kingambit such as Cinderace and Heatran. In turn, Dragapult often invites in opposing Kingambit, which resists its STAB options and is only threatened by its status moves, so solid switch-ins for this like Skarmory and Great Tusk are usually appreciated to prevent it from getting too many free turns. Raging Bolt in particular is a strong partner to pivot Dragapult on bulky offense teams that enjoy its support to help break through Ting-Lu, Clodsire, and specially defensive Gliscor. Heavy-Duty Boots Dragapult also struggles to muscle past bulkier checks like Toxapex and Clefable alone, so partners that can take advantage of them for setup opportunities such as Kingambit and Gholdengo are great picks. As Dragapult's Speed tier is almost unmatched in the OU metagame, Booster Energy users like Iron Valiant and Iron Boulder along with the even faster Deoxys-S are frequently forced in to revenge kill it, so more defensive teammates that can handle these threats are valued; Galarian Slowking is a good bulky pivot that takes on Iron Valiant and can use Chilly Reception to bring in Dragapult for free after taking a hit, while Gliscor, Corviknight, and Skarmory are solid Iron Boulder checks that can either beat it or force it to switch out and lose its Speed boost, allowing Dragapult to outspeed it later. Corviknight doubles as an answer to Deoxys-S, able to take on any of its attacks and safely pivot out with U-turn.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Dragapult is an amazing source of immediate power due to its near unresisted STAB combination, solid Special Attack, and excellent Speed tier, which outspeeds the majority of the unboosted metagame except Deoxys-S. Equipping Choice Specs allows Dragapult to break through Pokemon such as Gliscor and Zamazenta with its STAB moves. Flamethrower threatens Kingambit. U-turn allows Dragapult to keep the momentum for its team and hit Dark-types like Ting-Lu and Roaring Moon. Infiltrator allows Dragapult to be a great check to dual screens teams and Substitute sweepers such as Iron Defense Zamazenta. Tera Ghost powers up its most spammable STAB attack in Shadow Ball, allowing Dragapult to further dent Galarian Slowking and secure the OHKO on Iron Valiant and Skeledirge. This also improves its matchup into Iron Valiant and Enamorus, as it takes much less damage from Moonblast, allowing it to survive a hit and KO them back. Tera Dragon raises Draco Meteor to nuclear levels, OHKOing Gliscor, Dondozo, and defensive Landorus-T, and it also improves Dragapult's matchup into Darkrai and Gholdengo, as it removes it weakness to Dark Pulse and Shadow Ball, respectively. A Modest nature can be run instead of Timid to forego outspeeding Zamazenta, Weavile, and Darkrai for higher damage output, such as OHKOing Gliscor and Serperior with Draco Meteor.</p> <p>Dragapult fits well on offensive teams due to its excellent ability to break down walls such as Ting-Lu and Clodsire. Therefore, Dragapult is able to benefit sweepers like Gholdengo and Raging Bolt that appreciate walls being worn down. Dark- and Fairy-types like Kingambit, Roaring Moon, and Clefable are threats to Dragapult, as they are able to switch in and force it out. Therefore, checks to these such as Iron Valiant, Great Tusk, and Zamazenta make for good partners. The latter two help with Kingambit, which is Dragapult's biggest check due to resisting both of its STAB moves. Dragapult benefits from entry hazards on the opposing side of the field. Therefore, entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu and Gliscor are good partners for it. Knock Off support from the likes of Weavile, Roaring Moon, and Meowscarada are able to be brought in by Dragapult's U-turn, removing Heavy-Duty Boots from defensive switch-ins to force progress. Meowscarada in particular is a great partner, since it’s able to bring Dragapult in with its own U-turn, allowing Dragapult to better pressure its checks. Dragapult is not very good at switching into attacks, as it is relatively frail, so slow pivots like Galarian Slowking and Alomomola are amazing teammates. Entry hazards wear down Dragapult over time, limiting the number of times it can switch onto the field; therefore, hazard control from Great Tusk and Cinderace can help Dragapult. Deoxys-S and Booster Energy Pokemon with a Speed Boost such as Roaring Moon and Iron Valiant are able to outspeed and threaten to KO Dragapult, so speed control like Rillaboom, Raging Bolt and Kingambit make for good teammates.</p>"
      },
      "Focus Sash": {
        "description": "<p>Focus Sash Dragapult is an excellent status spreader and emergency check to various threats due to its incredible Speed, outspeeding every unboosted Pokemon except Deoxys-S, and Hex, which rewards status spreading further and hits status absorbers like Gliscor, Gholdengo, and Hatterene hard. Dragon Darts makes Dragapult a potent mixed wallbreaker, letting it slice through special walls like Clodsire and Blissey as well as Special Defense-boosting Pokemon like Raging Bolt. Draco Meteor is an alternative option to OHKO Walking Wake as well as Raging Bolt after Stealth Rock. However, its imperfect accuracy, Special Attack drops, and inability to hit most special walls for good damage compromises Dragapult's offensive capabilities. Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave combine to allow Dragapult to cripple nearly the entire metagame with the exceptions of Gholdengo and Garganacl as well as Blissey if it is running Draco Meteor over Dragon Darts. Will-O-Wisp is primarily good against physical attackers and Ground-types like Kingambit, Ogerpon-W, Great Tusk, and Ting-Lu, while Thunder Wave is used against special attackers, fast Pokemon, and burn-immune targets like Iron Valiant, Deoxys-S, and Tera Fire Zamazenta. Dragapult should run a Hasty nature when using Dragon Darts to hit hard physically and specially, but with Draco Meteor, it can run a Timid nature. Infiltrator allows Dragapult to status and revenge kill Substitute users like Zamazenta, Serperior, and Iron Moth. Tera Ghost gives Dragapult enough power to nearly always OHKO Skeledirge with a status-boosted Hex and 2HKO specially defensive Gliscor after Protect. Tera Dragon boosts Dragon Darts and Draco Meteor, allowing Dragon Darts to 2HKO Galarian Slowking and Blissey and Draco Meteor to OHKO Pokemon like Meowscarada, Raging Bolt without entry hazard chip, and Hisuian Samurott. Tera Fairy gives Dragapult a Dragon immunity and Dark resistance, which can allow it to survive hits from Pokemon like opposing Dragapult, Kingambit, and Choice Scarf Darkrai, especially if its Focus Sash is no longer intact.</p> <p>Dragapult fits on offensive teams that appreciate its emergency checking of many of the tier's scariest threats with its ability to paralyze and burn foes while still being offensively threatening. Dragapult's ability to cripple offensive threats is beneficial to many wallbreakers and sweepers like Ogerpon-W, Raging Bolt, and Kingambit by giving them setup opportunities on burned physical attackers and paralyzed Pokemon. These Pokemon also appreciate Dragapult paralyzing faster Pokemon to gain the jump on them, while Dragapult appreciates their ability to come in on Pokemon such as Ting-Lu and Terastallized Clodsire that wall it to force them out and wallbreak. Zamazenta and Kingambit appreciate Dragapult burning opposing Zamazenta, while Kingambit additionally appreciates opposing Kingambit being burned to win the mirror matchup. Raging Bolt has a much easier time breaking through burned Ting-Lu after Leftovers is neutralized while being able to take an Earthquake easier. Additionally, the aforementioned special attackers highly appreciate the Dragon Darts variant of Dragapult to wear down shared walls like Clodsire, Blissey, specially defensive Gliscor, and Ting-Lu. Dragapult's Focus Sash is broken by entry hazards, so Pokemon that can keep them off the field like Great Tusk, Iron Treads, Taunt Deoxys-S, and Taunt Landorus-T are excellent partners. Dragapult struggles to make meaningful progress against Pokemon like Garganacl, which can be alleviated with Pokemon like Raging Bolt, Encore Iron Valiant, and Rillaboom. Rillaboom's Grassy Terrain can additionally heal chip damage Dragapult takes to potentially restore its Focus Sash. Dragapult is not foolproof, as entry hazards can often be hard to keep off the field long enough and it only has one one activation of Focus Sash. Because of this, it often needs teammates that can serve as secondary checks to the sweepers Dragapult tries to cripple. Zamazenta can check Pokemon like Booster Energy Great Tusk, Weavile, and Kingambit and doubles up on speed control. Gholdengo can help overwhelm Dark-types and even lure them with Dazzling Gleam and Focus Blast while also checking Iron Valiant and Enamorus. Priority users like Kingambit, Raging Bolt, and especially Dragonite and Rillaboom due to their more consistent priority moves can revenge kill Pokemon that Dragapult fails to status like Choice Scarf Meowscarada, which can OHKO it with Triple Axel. Faster Pokemon like Iron Valiant, +1 Roaring Moon, and Deoxys-S can also be problematic if Dragapult's Focus Sash is not maintained.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Dragapult acts as a great offensive pivot for bulky offense and balance teams that rely on maintaining momentum and immediate power for their progress making. Its amazing Speed tier, the second fastest relevant Pokemon behind only Deoxys-S, makes it one of the best users of Choice Band, hitting foes for great neutral damage thanks to its hard-to-resist STAB moves Tera Blast Ghost lets it make use of a reliable and powerful physical Ghost-type move, 2HKOing otherwise problematic Steel- and Fairy-types such as Clefable and Corviknight after Stealth Rock Damage, and to create win-win scenarios thanks to the pivoting effect of its strong U-turn forcing progress even against bulkier cores and punishing Dark-types such as Kingambit and Ting-Lu with heavy chip damage, especially if Spikes are up. Tera Dragon over Tera Ghost with Phantom Force over Tera Blast is a notable option to rely less on Terastallization in exchange for a worse Ghost-type move, OHKOing the likes of Galarian Slowking, Darkrai, Hisuian Samurott, and Glimmora through its Focus Sash and 2HKOing neutral targets like Great Tusk, Dondozo, and Alomomola with little prior chip damage with Tera Dragon Dragon Darts while also shedding its Dark weakness. Quick Attack rounds Dragapult's moveset out, giving it access to priority to pick off weakened foes or other priority users, though other options include Sucker Punch, for a stronger hit on neutral targets and an advantage against opposing Dragapult, and Phantom Force to be less reliant on Tera. Clear Body is preferred, as it allows Dragapult to ignore Landorus-T's Intimidate and Sticky Web, though Infiltrator is still a valid alternative to ignore dual screens and threaten Substitute Iron Moth, Primarina, and Enamorus.</p> <p>Dragapult has great synergy with bulky VoltTurn cores, which allow Dragapult to easily get on and off the field and repeatedly scare out offensive threats such as Iron Moth, Iron Crown, Gholdengo, and Darkrai. Landorus-T and Hisuian Samurott are pivots that pair well with Dragapult, with the former switching well into Kingambit, Cinderace, Roaring Moon, and Zamazenta trying to revenge kill Dragapult while denying hazards from Pokemon such as Skarmory, Glimmora, Garganacl, and opposing Landorus-T with Taunt, and the latter's Knock Off variants removing Heavy-Duty Boots off of physical walls Dragapult might struggle with like Alomomola and Dondozo. They, alongside the likes of Garganacl, Clefable, and Gliscor, also provide entry hazards, putting foes like Ogerpon, Darkrai, opposing Hisuian Samurott, and Iron Valiant in range of an OHKO and Skarmory, Corviknight, offensive Great Tusk, and Alomomola in range of a 2HKO; Garganacl in particular is noteworthy for its ability to deal effectively with opposing Dragapult, as well as absorbing status that would otherwise severely limit Dragapult's effectiveness like burn from Alomomola, paralysis from Clefable, and Toxic from Gliscor. Rapid Spin support from the likes of Great Tusk, which also deals with Kingambit, or Magic Bounce support from Hatterene, which has a great matchup into Ting-Lu and Zamazenta variants lacking Heavy Slam and can absorb status, also benefits Dragapult. Corviknight is another good pivot, providing a Kingambit check for bulkier structures and dealing with sweepers such as Roaring Moon that can boost past Dragapult's Speed tier with Iron Defense or reliably removing hazards against teams without Gholdengo with Defog. Finally, Future Sight from Iron Crown, Galarian Slowking, or the previously mentioned Hatterene helps overwhelm defensive cores that rely on different Pokemon to take on physical and special attacks like Galarian Slowking + Alomomola or Corviknight, Blissey + Dondozo, and Iron Crown + Landorus-T. Iron Crown brings to the table fast pivoting and a strong offensive profile to better deal with Clefable while not letting Kingambit or Heatran switch in for free. In contrast, Galarian Slowking has slow pivoting and great longevity thanks to Regenerator. Similarly, offensive overlap with threats like Dragonite, Zamazenta, and Hisuian Samurott can be very effective at muscling past shared checks like Skarmory, Clefable, Zamazenta, Dondozo, and Alomomola with repeated pressure.</p>"

  "Zamazenta": {
    "sets": {
      "Iron Defense": {
        "description": "<p>Iron Defense Zamazenta is a fast sweeper for offense that also happens to blanket check most of the physical metagame with great matchups into key threats such as Kingambit, Great Tusk, and Weavile. It acts as a strong form of role compression that can make use of its great bulk, a Defense boost from Dauntless Shield, and its high Speed stat to find opportunities to use Iron Defense to not only bolster its survivability but also strengthen the power of its Body Press. Crunch is a necessity to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types like Gholdengo, Skeledirge, and Galarian Slowking that aren't threatened by Body Press, while its last moveslot is more flexible; Heavy Slam gives Zamazenta super effective coverage into Fairy-types that otherwise would wall it such as Clefable, Enamorus, and Iron Valiant, while Roar can be used to force out Pokemon that aim to beat it with Defense-boosting moves like Skarmory, Corviknight, and opposing Zamazenta as well as also turning Zamazenta into a panic check able to force out setup sweepers and Booster Energy users like Roaring Moon and Great Tusk. Substitute is an alternative that allows Zamazenta to dodge status moves from the likes of Gliscor, Galarian Slowking, and Toxapex along with helping to block revenge killing attempts from faster Pokemon such as Booster Energy Iron Valiant and Choice Scarf Gholdengo. Stone Edge can also be considered to give Zamazenta a non-contact option to hit Zapdos and Moltres while still giving it coverage to hit Enamorus, at the expense of losing its ability to hit other Fairy-types and the utility of Roar or Substitute. 168 EVs in Speed allow Zamazenta to outrun Adamant Dragonite after a Dragon Dance while also outrunning key threats like Weavile and Darkrai. Zamazenta can then choose to invest EVs into HP for better overall bulk or into Attack for stronger coverage moves; notably, maximum HP investment ensures that Zamazenta will survive Choice Scarf Enamorus's Moonblast from full while also avoiding a 2HKO from Clefable. Choosing to maximize Attack gives Zamazenta a clean 2HKO on offensive Gholdengo with Crunch and on both Clefable and Hatterene with Heavy Slam. The remaining EVs are invested in Defense to improve Zamazenta's bulk and give it a stronger Body Press. Tera Steel is one of Zamazenta's best options, defensively flipping the matchup into Fairy-, Psychic-, and Flying-type attacks from foes like Enamorus, Galarian Slowking, Deoxys-S, and Dragon Dance Roaring Moon while also powering up Heavy Slam to OHKO both Enamorus and Iron Valiant even without Attack investment. Tera Steel also gives Zamazenta a crucial immunity to Toxic from Gliscor and Toxapex. Tera Fire serves to grant Zamazenta a key Fairy resistance without making it weak to Fighting-type moves from Iron Valiant, but the primary draw of this Tera type is an immunity to burn, a particularly important quality against Dragapult, Skeledirge, and Moltres, with the former and the latter able to burn even Substitute variants of Zamazenta with Infiltrator and Flame Body. Tera Fairy is another solid defensive typing for Zamazenta, granting it a great defensive profile that includes a resistance to Fighting-type attacks that helps out immensely in the Iron Defense mirror matchup against both Zamazenta and Skarmory, as well as an immunity to Dragapult's Draco Meteor and a retained resistance to Dark-type attacks that allows you to still check Weavile and Roaring Moon; Tera Ghost is an option that leans even heavier into beating opposing Iron Defense users at the expense of granting little defensive value.</p> <p>Zamazenta is a great fit on both bulky offense and hyper offense teams that need a fast offensive piece with good matchups into the tier's physical threats, in particular providing a crucial Kingambit check to a team. However, to be able to fully leverage its defensive value, it appreciates entry hazard removal to allow it to switch in without taking chip damage on entry and potentially being neutered entirely by Toxic Spikes. Hatterene is a particularly good partner in this regard, as it not only blocks entry hazards but can also be used to weaken shared checks like Gholdengo, Galarian Slowking, and Skeledirge, and Great Tusk can clear hazards from the field along with helping to wear down Gliscor and force in and chip down Gholdengo attempting to block Rapid Spin. Rillaboom also serves as a great pairing that helps to bolster Zamazenta's longevity, with the additional healing from Grassy Terrain making Zamazenta much more difficult to remove from the field. Zamazenta's ability to check the tier's offensive Dark-types is also a valuable quality for hyper offense teams that opt to run a hazard lead like Glimmora or Deoxys-S, as these builds often use Gholdengo to block hazard removal; this will often give threats like Kingambit, Weavile, and Hisuian Samurott free attacks that necessitate an offensive switch-in that Zamazenta provides. Zamazenta is then able to take advantage of these Pokemon by using them as setup fodder. Gholdengo itself is a strong partner to Zamazenta, able to switch into Fairy- and Psychic-type attacks from Enamorus, Iron Valiant, and Hatterene while also taking advantage of Zamazenta's defensive checks like Galarian Slowking and Clefable being unable to touch it. Zamazenta's relatively low wallbreaking power unfortunately leaves it struggling to muscle through Unaware walls like Dondozo, Skeledirge, and Clodsire, while its inability to boost the strength of its coverage moves makes bulkier Pokemon that don't fear Body Press like defensive Gholdengo and Galarian Slowking hard to break through; Zamazenta matches up best into opposing offense teams, and so balance breakers and stallbreakers are appreciated to support it in its other matchups. One strong offensive pairing with Zamazenta is Dragon Dance Roaring Moon, as it can weaken Skarmory and remove its Rocky Helmet to allow Zamazenta to later break through it. In particular, Roaring Moon's ability to chunk Dondozo and force it to take hazard damage with Knock Off is much appreciated to help Zamazenta make progress against it. Kingambit is another excellent teammate for Zamazenta, loading well into bulkier teams and heavily pressuring Dondozo while also being able to switch into Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Hatterene that may come in to force Zamazenta out. A great partner to Zamazenta on hyper offensive teams is Booster Energy Iron Valiant, able to weaken shared checks like Gholdengo, Galarian Slowking, and Skeledirge for Zamazenta to later break through. Iron Valiant also provides hyper offensive teams with a temporary form of speed control that can outrun Dragapult and Deoxys-S, both of which outspeed and can threaten Zamazenta with strong special attacks, or, in Dragapult's case, debilitating status with Will-O-Wisp.</p>"
      },
      "All-Out Attacker": {
        "description": "<p>With an outstanding Speed tier, fantastic natural bulk and the raw power to match, all-out attacking Zamazenta is one of the tier's best natural forms of speed control and a great one-time check to some of the tier's most dominant physical threats like Kingambit and Ogerpon-W with Dauntless Shield. A powerful Close Combat is backed up by Heavy Slam to hit Fairy-types like Hatterene, Clefable, and Iron Valiant, while Crunch allows for Zamazenta to hit Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Gholdengo, Dragapult, and Galarian Slowking. Stone Edge lets Zamazenta secure a 2HKO on Tera Flying Roaring Moon and specially defensive Skeledirge, along with dealing massive damage to Moltres. Alternatively, Zamazenta can opt to run Ice Fang as its strongest move against Gliscor and Landorus-T, coming with the additional benefit of comfortably 2HKOing Dragonite, while Psychic Fangs is a niche option that allows for Zamazenta to hit both Clodsire and Toxapex while improving its matchup against dual screens hyper offense teams. Heavy-Duty Boots allows for Zamazenta to switch in safely regardless of entry hazards and fully leverage its bulk, allowing for it to come in multiple times over the course of a game. Choice Band can instead be used to greatly enhance its wallbreaking power, granting it key 2HKOs on Skarmory, Corviknight, and offensive Great Tusk, but this comes at the expense of Zamazenta losing out on longevity and the ability to hit subsequent switch-ins with its coverage options. An alternative spread of 88 HP / 252 Atk / 168 Spe, again with a Jolly nature, allows for Zamazenta to still outrun +1 Adamant Dragonite, Weavile, and Darkrai while improving its bulk. This HP investment notably allows for Zamazenta to live Enamorus's Moonblast and even +1 Dragon Dance Roaring Moon's Acrobatics with Dauntless Shield active, but the lack of Speed is detrimental for the matchup against opposing Zamazenta. Tera Steel is selected to flip Zamazenta's matchup against Fairy-, Psychic-, and Flying-type attacks from Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Enamorus, Galarian Slowking, and Dragon Dance Roaring Moon while also turning Heavy Slam into a powerful STAB option that cleanly OHKOes both Iron Valiant and Enamorus and providing Zamazenta with an immunity to Toxic from Galarian Slowking. Tera Stellar can instead be considered as an option that gives a one-time boost to all of its moves; this boost is strong enough to allow for Zamazenta to OHKO offensive Cinderace and a slightly chipped Ogerpon-W with Close Combat, while also giving it 2HKOs on both Raging Bolt and Pelipper with Close Combat and Stone Edge, respectively. This also gives Zamazenta a one-time nuke to break through weakened checks like Skarmory and Corviknight. However, this comes at the expense of Tera Stellar having no defensive value. Tera Fighting is a more niche option without any defensive merit that Zamazenta can opt to run, only boosting its Close Combat but crucially letting it 2HKO Skarmory after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Zamazenta is a great fit for both balance and offense teams lacking speed control while giving these builds a check to Dark-types like Kingambit, Weavile, Meowscarada, and Darkrai. It appreciates entry hazard support to take full advantage of the switches it forces, pairing well with hazard setters such as Skarmory, Ting-Lu, and Gliscor on balance and Landorus-T and Glimmora on offense. Zamazenta's ability to check both Weavile and Meowscarada pairs particularly well with Pokemon like Gliscor and Landorus-T; Zamazenta's lack of recovery means that it struggles to switch in consistently on these Pokemon though. This makes bulky pivots like Galarian Slowking and Alomomola much appreciated to allow it safe entry onto the field, the former also providing a much-needed switch-in to Moonblast from Iron Valiant and Enamorus. Galarian Slowking in particular forms a potent combination with Zamazenta, as Zamazenta's Close Combat dissuades Dark- and Steel-types like Kingambit, Ting-Lu, and Roaring Moon from switching into Galarian Slowking's Future Sight, while common switch-ins to Zamazenta such as Gliscor, Great Tusk, and Skarmory cannot safely come in and take both hits. Although Zamazenta's Speed tier is impressive by OU standards, it is still outsped by Dragapult, Deoxys-S, and Choice Scarf users like Enamorus and Gholdengo, which are able to threaten it with heavy damage; priority attackers that can revenge kill these faster threats are therefore much appreciated. Kingambit in particular is a strong partner that can switch into Dragapult and Gholdengo and threaten both of these targets along with Deoxys-S with Sucker Punch, while Weavile cannot freely switch into these threats but is able to provide an alternative form of speed control that can also threaten Dragapult, Enamorus, and Dragon Dance Roaring Moon with Ice Shard. With Booster Energy, Iron Valiant is also able to outspeed and threaten Zamazenta with Moonblast; Gholdengo makes for a solid check to Iron Valiant, also being able to come in on Galarian Slowking and Clefable that would live a hit and threaten Zamazenta back. In turn, Gholdengo appreciates Zamazenta's ability to threaten many of its common checks like Kingambit, Weavile, and Meowscarada. Rillaboom also makes for a great partner to pick off Deoxys-S and Iron Valiant with Grassy Glide while weakening shared checks like Skarmory and Corviknight with Knock Off to allow for Zamazenta to freely attack them without taking Rocky Helmet damage. Rillaboom's Grassy Terrain is particularly useful for providing Zamazenta with recovery to help maintain its longevity; Alomomola can similarly help to alleviate this issue by providing Wish support while also appreciating Zamazenta's ability to check Ogerpon-W. Zamazenta is walled by Gliscor and Clodsire when using Stone Edge as its coverage option, and so switch-ins to these Pokemon such as Gliscor itself and Clefable on balance and Hatterene on offense make valuable partners, along with powerful attackers like Weavile and Meowscarada to directly threaten them out. Zamazenta pressures some of the tier's common physical walls like Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Skarmory; teammates like Kingambit and Weavile appreciate its ability to weaken these targets.</p>"

  "Ursaluna": {
    "sets": {
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Ursaluna's nigh-unparalleled offensive prowess makes it one of the most brutal wallbreakers in the tier. The combination of Guts and STAB Facade off of Ursaluna's gargantuan Attack stat is alarming for many bulky teams, with even the most physically bulky Pokemon such as Dondozo, Great Tusk, and Ting-Lu getting 2HKOed unboosted. Ursaluna's offensive presence is further pushed by its good offensive typing, having unresisted coverage and making the likes of Garganacl and Heatran fearful of Ursaluna. Swords Dance further bolsters this offensive profile, letting Ursaluna take better advantage of the switches it often forces. The power boost lets Ursaluna land OHKOs on common Pokemon such as Gliscor and defensive Landorus-T. Fire Punch targets Steel-types immune to Ground like Air Balloon Gholdengo, Corviknight, and Skarmory that would otherwise check Ursaluna. Flame Orb triggers Guts and makes Ursaluna an adept status absorber thanks to its solid natural bulk and ability to threaten status spreaders like Gliscor, Gholdengo, and Zapdos. Tera Normal boosts Ursaluna's Facade to ungodly levels; it can overwhelm even the most bulky of physical walls like Dondozo and can OHKO the likes of Zapdos, Moltres, and Gliscor after minor chip damage. Tera Ghost gives Ursaluna immunity to Fighting-type attacks from Pokemon like Zamazenta, Corviknight, and Skarmory. Ursaluna's natural bulk also opens it up to being versatile at taking advantage of Terastallization, as it can often afford to take neutral hits from powerful threats such as Ogerpon-W and Walking Wake after Terastallizing into types like Fairy or Grass and launch a counterattack in return. While an Adamant nature with maximum Speed investment is generally preferred for outspeeding the likes of Kingambit and Corviknight, a Brave nature, combined with maximum investment in HP and Attack, turns Ursaluna into a monstrous threat on Trick Room teams. Even outside of Trick Room teams, this variant can function as a powerful and bulky wallbreaker, taking advantage of Pokemon such as Iron Moth and Zapdos to switch in and wreak havoc.</p> <p>Ursaluna fits on many bulky offense teams as a strong wallbreaker. Entry hazard support from Glimmora and Gliscor provides chip damage to help Ursaluna further overwhelm defensive Pokemon. Landorus-T, in addition to being an entry hazard setter, is an amazing pivot thanks to Intimidate giving Ursaluna more ease coming into battle. Fast offensive Pokemon such as Zamazenta, Weavile, and Dragapult appreciate Ursaluna knocking out defensive Pokemon such as Gliscor, Dondozo, and Clefable, respectively. In return, they can help clean late-game against faster-paced offensive teams. Ursaluna tends to struggle against common offensive Pokemon such as Iron Valiant, Zamazenta, and Kyurem that can outspeed and threaten Ursaluna. Offensive Pokemon that can handle these threats, namely Gholdengo, Zamazenta, and Kingambit, make for strong teammates. These Pokemon heavily appreciate Ursaluna threatening defensive Pokemon like Ting-Lu, Skeledirge, and Great Tusk. Priority users such as Dragonite and Scizor appreciate Ursaluna's strong wallbreaking abilities that let them have an easier time cleaning late-game while also providing utility against faster offensive Pokemon. Defensive pivots such as Galarian Slowking and Alomomola do wonders in terms of letting Ursaluna switch in on offensive Pokemon thanks to their low Speed and Chilly Reception and Flip Turn, respectively, ensuring Ursaluna enters the field with as minimal damage taken as possible. The former is a great check to Pokemon that can beat Ursaluna, while the latter can help Ursaluna's longevity with Wish. On more aggressive teams, Alolan Ninetales can provide Aurora Veil support, boosting Ursaluna's already solid bulk and letting it more easily set up Swords Dance against bulkier foes. Ursaluna, with minimum Speed investment, is a hugely important aspect of Trick Room teams, often acting as the premier offensive threat on said teams. Hatterene is a natural choice for a Trick Room setter thanks to Magic Bounce letting it block Taunt, as well as entry hazards that would otherwise further compromise Ursaluna's bulk.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Enamorus can be a sweeper, a form of speed control that allows it to function as an effective revenge killer, and a support Pokemon that gives a teammate a second chance at sweeping via Healing Wish. Choice Scarf is used to outspeed faster common threats such as Zamazenta, Dragapult, and Attack Booster Energy Roaring Moon. Earth Power is mandatory coverage for hitting Fairy resistant foes: Steel-types like non-Air Balloon Gholdengo and Iron Treads, Fire-types like Heatran and Skeledirge, and Poison-types like Galarian Slowking and Clodsire. Tera Stellar Tera Blast gives Enamorus a way to boost its Special Attack thanks to Contrary while simultaneously sniping opposing Terastallized Pokemon like Kingambit. Tera Stellar hits everything in the tier neutrally, so it's able to snowball and clean weakened teams effectively. Mystical Fire is a good alternative, letting it hit Steel-types immune to Earth Power, such as Skarmory, Corviknight, and Air Balloon Gholdengo while also making Enamorus not as Tera-reliant. Healing Wish sacrifices Enamorus in order to fully heal a chipped sweeper like Kingambit or Raging Bolt so it can continue a sweep it couldn't finish previously, and should be used when Enamorus's speed is no longer needed to win the game. Tera Ground can be used instead of Tera Stellar to power up Earth Power and to flip Enamorus's poor matchups against Raging Bolt's Thunderclap and Galarian Slowking's Sludge Bomb. Tera Fairy can also be used to further boost Moonblast's power, guaranteeing 2HKOs against Ting-Lu and neutral targets like specially defensive Gliscor.</p> <p>Enamorus is best used as speed control on offensive teams that appreciate it giving teammates a potential second chance to sweep. Hazard removers like Court Change Cinderace and Great Tusk are excellent teammates, since Stealth Rock limits the amount of times Enamorus can come in and revenge kill. Cinderace can give hazards to the foe if they aren't on both sides of the field, its access to U-turn helps get Enamorus in safely, and its Pyro Balls force Gholdengo off the field so Enamorus can use Moonblast more freely. Great Tusk is a great teammate, because it threatens common Enamorus switch-ins like Galarian Slowking, Heatran, and Toxapex, and checks Kingambit, which can take a hit from Enamorus and retaliate back. Galarian Slowking is a pivot that greatly appreciates Enamorus's presence since it can deal with the Dark- and Ground-types that annoy it such as Ting-Lu, Great Tusk, and Darkrai. Enamorus appreciates Galarian Slowking's presence too, as its access to Future Sight is extremely useful for muscling through Poison-types like Toxapex and opposing Galarian Slowking and for bulky neutral targets like Gliscor. Galarian Slowking's access to status moves like Toxic and Thunder Wave allows it to incapacitate Pokemon that may give Enamorus a hard time like Iron Valiant, Walking Wake, and Iron Boulder. Chilly Reception is used to bring Enamorus onto the field safely, but also has the added benefit of changing the weather, giving rain Pokemon like Barraskewda, Raging Bolt, and Iron Treads a harder time. Another pivot Enamorus loves pairing with is Landorus-T, since it can bring Enamorus in safely with U-turn, threaten all the Poison- and Steel- types Enamorus struggles with, and can set Stealth Rock. Bulky physical setup sweepers such as Dragonite and Great Tusk work well with Enamorus since they're able to deal with special walls that can prevent it from making progress, mainly Galarian Slowking, and change the tide of a battle if they're able to get a second chance at sweeping thanks to Healing Wish. Physical Dark-types like Kingambit and Roaring Moon are more Pokemon who enjoy Enamorus's presence, since it can take on one of their best checks in Zamazenta, and Healing Wish can allow them to achieve a late-game sweep in case they had to come in earlier and sustain lots of damage. They're also able to blow past common Enamorus checks such as Galarian Slowking, Gholdengo, and Clodsire. Hazard setters like Glimmora and Hisuian Samurott can help chip foes into range for Enamorus to break through their team, and Gholdengo is appreciated to block removal attempts and keep the hazards up for the duration of the game.</p>"
      },
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Enamorus is a powerful Calm Mind sweeper and wallbreaker that is powerful enough to break through many foes. Earth Power gives Enamorus the ability to damage Galarian Slowking significantly, as well as targeting Gholdengo, Clodsire, and Heatran and OHKOing offensive Kingambit after a Calm Mind. Substitute is a great utility move, allowing Enamorus to block revenge killing attempts as well as avoid status moves, preventing Pokemon like Gliscor and Clodsire from affecting it with Toxic. Taunt is an alternative option that, as well as also blocking Toxic, can block walls like Corviknight and Clodsire from being able to recover and prevent opposing sweepers like Primarina from setting up and trying to beat it one-on-one. Leftovers provides Enamorus with a consistent recovery option, whereas Heavy-Duty Boots removes its weakness to Stealth Rock. Tera Ground can be used to increase the strength of Earth Power as well as flip Enamorus's weakness to Poison-type moves like Galarian Slowking's Sludge Bomb to a resistance. It's also useful to immediately remove Enamorus's weakness to Electric, allowing it to block Raging Bolt's Thunderclap and defeat it with Moonblast. Tera Steel turns many of Enamorus's key move weaknesses into resistances, including Galarian Slowking's Sludge Bomb, Weavile and Meowscarada's Triple Axel, Gholdengo's Make It Rain, and Dragonite's Extreme Speed, which allows it to set up a Substitute or Calm Mind and punish the aforementioned Pokemon. Tera Fairy boosts the power of Enamorus's Fairy-type STAB moves, allowing it to secure an OHKO on Zamazenta.</p> <p>Enamorus benefits from more offensive team structures where it can be used to support its teammates with its ability to boost up and sweep through teams. Enamorus's typing makes it extremely dangerous to Fighting-, Dragon-, and Dark-types like Great Tusk, Roaring Moon, and Ting-Lu, respectively, while also turning Pokemon like Gliscor and Landorus-T into setup fodder. This opens up teammates such as Gholdengo, Heatran, and Cinderace to play more freely with Enamorus able to threaten out their shared checks. In return, Cinderace is able to support Enamorus by providing entry hazard control in the form of Court Change. Enamorus is not particularly bulky, so it's vulnerable to Pokemon that it can't KO easily and can KO it back in turn. One of the most prominent Pokemon that fits this description is Galarian Slowking, which can take all of Enamorus's attacks and threaten it in return with Sludge Bomb. Kingambit is a great teammate to have as a switch-in to Sludge Bomb and Future Sight that can also force out Galarian Slowking. Kingambit also checks Gholdengo, which is another Pokemon that's difficult for Enamorus to deal with, as well as helping with priority from Sucker Punch, threatening faster foes like Deoxys-S and Iron Boulder. Bulkier Pokemon such as Blissey that can handle Enamorus's attacks present a problem that Enamorus can't get around on its own; having teammates like Roaring Moon, Zamazenta, and Ogerpon-W can therefore help in breaking through. Great Tusk can also support Enamorus with Rapid Spin as a way of getting rid of Stealth Rock if Enamorus isn't running Heavy-Duty Boots. Offensive teammates like Serperior and Gholdengo appreciate Enamorus's ability to weaken checks like Clodsire; in return, Gholdengo can help deal with Galarian Slowking and Corviknight.</p>"

      "Boots Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>Meowscarada is one of the tier's premier offensive pivots thanks to its stupendous base 123 Speed, a critical benchmark that lets it outspeed scary threats like Cinderace, Iron Valiant, Roaring Moon, and Serperior. Knock Off scares some of the tier's key dangers like Deoxys-Speed, Dragapult, and Gholdengo while simultaneously threatening to cripple other switch-ins like Hatterene and Corviknight. Flower Trick cuts through bulky threats such as Dondozo, Great Tusk, and Primarina, even ignoring the former two's potential Defense boosts, while Triple Axel gives Meowscarada a crucial Ice-type STAB move that allows it to nail common Pokemon such as Clodsire, Gliscor, Raging Bolt, and Roaring Moon. U-turn could be used in the last slot for keeping momentum while chipping switch-ins such as Kingambit and Hatterene. Alternatively, Meowscarada can run Low Kick to smack Kingambit. Heavy-Duty Boots is practically a requirement on this set, as Meowscarada will frequently be switching in and out of combat and is otherwise quite weak to hazards. Tera Grass and Dark enhance Flower Trick and Knock Off while Tera Fire grants Meowscarada some crucial resistances to Fairy, Ice, and Steel-type attacks such as those from Enamorus, Darkrai, and Choice Scarf Gholdengo. Tera Electric is an additional option that allows Meowscarada to feast on Zapdos more effectively thanks to a newly gained Static immunity and resistance to both of its STAB moves.</p> <p>Meowscarada fits best on balance teams that need a way to force hazard chip along with Knock Off spam to whittle down or outright threaten Pokemon that otherwise don't mind Knock Off such as Gliscor. Meowscarada's frailty courtesy of its pitiful bulk is sometimes hard to work around and limits its switch in opportunities, especially with common weaknesses courtesy of its exploitable defensive typing and a nasty 4x weakness to U-turn. Furthermore, Meowscarada, while being quite fast, is still outsped by monsters such as Darkrai, Dragapult, Weavile, and Zamazenta, the latter of which happens to be one of Meowscarada's best checks. Weavile's offensive tenacity combined with deadly Speed makes it a potent threat, which is why Rocky Helmet Skarmory is one of Meowscarada's best partner options on balance teams, as it punishes Triple Axel spam and shrugs off Weavile's hits comparatively easily. Meowscarada's role as an offensive pivot helps chip away at opposing cores while also bringing some of their key defensive threats into OHKO range for some frail teammates like Darkrai, Iron Boulder, and Gholdengo. Dragapult is another great partner for Meowscarada; it can blank Fighting-type attacks and follow up with a fast Will-O-Wisp to neuter Zamazenta as well. Meowscarada's defensive woes can be covered by bulky teammates that don't mind taking coverage moves from faster threats. On the physical side, Great Tusk's role as a physically bulky offensive spinner with synergistic typing opens up multiple opportunities to clear hazards. On the special side, Clodsire and Galarian Slowking are both impressive partners thanks to their longevity and fantastic defensive profiles, with the former being able to blank setup sweepers like Darkrai and the latter being able to continue Meowscarada's momentum chain by using a slow Chilly Reception to take a hit or scout a switch, allowing Meowscarada to come in safely. Additionally, Galarian Slowking also threatens Pokemon that would commonly switch into Meowscarada like Iron Defense Zamazenta with Future Sight.</p>"

      "Choice Item": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Item Meowscarada distinguishes itself as an amazing wallbreaker and offensive pivot of the tier thanks to its great Attack and Speed stats and fantastic coverage options alongside Protean, capable of dismantling common defensive picks such as Dondozo, Galarian Slowking, and Ting-Lu. Choice Band boosts its wallbreaking prowess to nuclear levels, whereas Choice Scarf makes it a great revenge killer capable of outspeeding foes like +1 Iron Valiant, Deoxys-S, and +1 Roaring Moon. Triple Axel functions as an incredible coverage move, hitting foes like Gliscor, Roaring Moon, Dragonite, and Enamorus super effectively. U-turn allows Meowscarada to gain momentum against common switch-ins like Kingambit, Skarmory, and Corviknight. Trick can also be used over Flower Trick to cripple checks like Skarmory and bulky setup sweepers like Hatterene to hamper their effectiveness and giving Meowscarada more flexibility with moves. Tera Dark boosts the power of its Knock Off, notably allowing Choice Scarf Meowscarada to OHKO Galarian Slowking and Choice Band Meowscarada to OHKO offensive Cinderace. Tera Fire makes Meowscarada resistant to Ice, Fairy, and Fire, helping it against foes like Darkrai, Enamorus, and Moltres while also making it immune to Will-O-Wisp from the likes of Dragapult and Moltres's Flame Body. In addition, Choice Scarf Meowscarada no longer OHKOes Gliscor, Roaring Moon, and Rillaboom, while Choice Band variants lose the OHKO on Raging Bolt. Finally, Tera Grass allows Meowscarada's Flower Trick to reach new heights of power, enabling Choice Scarf variants to secure an OHKO on bulky Calm Mind Primarina and Choice Band variants to OHKO maximum HP Great Tusk.</p> <p>Choice Item Meowscarada fits well on bulky offense structures that appreciate its ability to pivot and remove items from opposing Pokemon, especially defensive ones, with Knock Off. Teammates such as Gholdengo appreciate Meowscarada pivoting against switch-ins like Skarmory and Corviknight, giving them opportunities to set up and clean. Other setup sweepers like Iron Defense Zamazenta also appreciate Meowscarada's ability to revenge kill foes like Gholdengo and non-Choice Scarf Enamorus for them to set up and sweep with minimum hindrance. Entry hazard setters like Ting-Lu, Skarmory, and Gliscor also appreciate Meowscarada using Knock Off to remove Heavy-Duty Boots, which makes foes like Moltres and Zapdos take hazard damage. Special wallbreakers like Enamorus and Raging Bolt also appreciate Meowscarada threatening special walls like Primarina and Galarian Slowking. Meowscarada struggles against Steel-types like Skarmory and Kingambit. Thus, teammates that threaten them, such as Dragapult and the aforementioned Gholdengo for Skarmory, and Pokemon like Zamazenta and Great Tusk for Kingambit, are appreciated. Zamazenta itself is also a threat to Meowscarada, so teammates that check it such as the aforementioned Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Enamorus should be acknowledged. Galarian Slowking also deserves a special mention as a teammate, as its Future Sight has excellent synergy with Meowscarada and helps it deal with Zamazenta as well as other Fighting-types like Iron Valiant by making Meowscarada's moves, especially Knock Off, harder to switch into with these Pokemon. In addition, it also forms a strong pivoting core with Meowscarada. Due to the risk of being Choice-locked into the wrong move, Meowscarada is also quite prediction reliant when facing structures with Pokemon like Gliscor and Dondozo. Therefore, Pokemon that pressure such cores, like Raging Bolt and Dragapult, are excellent partners. Meowscarada also doesn't like taking chip damage from hazards, as it repeatedly wants to pivot in and out of the field. Thus, it appreciates hazard control from teammates such as Great Tusk.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Due to its great natural bulk, unique defensive typing, and access to Unaware, Skeledirge manages to be a fantastic defensive presence that is able to stave off the likes of Volcarona, Iron Valiant, and Zamazenta. Torch Song is a phenomenal Fire-type STAB move that allows Skeledirge to exert offensive pressure while still providing a defensive backbone. Slack Off lets Skeledirge stay healthy throughout the game, giving it multiple opportunities to switch in on powerful offensive threats such as Iron Moth and Zamazenta. Will-O-Wisp quickly neutralizes physical attackers like Dragonite, in addition to powering up Skeledirge's Hex. Hex is an incredibly strong and spammable Ghost-type STAB move that synergizes amazingly with Will-O-Wisp; Alluring Voice allows Skeledirge to threaten Taunt Roaring Moon and Dragonite in addition to being a respectably strong STAB move with the use of Tera Fairy; Scorching Sands can be considered as it can threaten Heatran and Gouging Fire, as well as being an alternative method of spreading burn. Maximizing its HP and Special Defense enables Skeledirge to more reliably check special attackers, notably Volcarona and Enamorus; conversely, maximizing its HP and Defense turns Skeledirge into an immensely sturdy physical wall, forgoing its reliance on spreading burn by leveraging its raw physical bulk to check potent setup sweepers, particularly Dragonite and Swords Dance Iron Valiant. Tera Fairy provides Skeledirge with a much-appreciated resistance to Dark, allowing it to safely check Pokemon such as Meowscarada and Roaring Moon, in addition to always checking Volcarona regardless of its Tera type; conversely, Tera Water allows Skeledirge to sit in front of powerful wallbreakers, notably Calm Mind Primarina and Gouging Fire, and its neutral defensive profile allows it to safely check Pokemon like Kingambit.</p> <p>Skeledirge fits on balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate its ability to force progress while staving off opposing threats. It dislikes taking Knock Off due to its reliance on Heavy-Duty Boots, so it appreciates teammates such as Clefable and Skarmory that can safely switch into Knock Off from Weavile and Iron Valiant. Skeledirge also enjoys having Clefable in particular absorb Salt Cure from Garganacl; Clefable also appreciates Skeledirge's reliability in forcing out Galarian Slowking and Iron Moth. Rillaboom and Galarian Slowking are much-appreciated teammates for Skeledirge, as Rillaboom provides Skeledirge with Grassy Terrain to bolster its longevity in addition to forcing out Ogerpon-W that would otherwise threaten it, whereas Galarian Slowking can pivot into and around powerful wallbreakers such as Kyurem and Walking Wake. It also enjoys entry hazard support from Gliscor and Skarmory wearing down Pokemon such as Choice Specs Kyurem that would otherwise threaten Skeledirge and its team. Skarmory also assists Skeledirge in answering Choice Band Rillaboom, which otherwise threatens it with Knock Off, reliably checks Kingambit for it and appreciates having a consistent check to Volcarona and Gouging Fire. Gliscor can spread status with Toxic to power up Skeledirge's Hex and relishes in having a sturdy switch-in to Serperior. Skeledirge also benefits from pairing with fast wallbreakers such as Weavile, Dragapult, and Ogerpon-W, providing them with a sturdy defensive backbone and appreciating having them weaken the opposing team's defenses, as they open up Skeledirge to sweep late-game with Torch Song; it also greatly enjoys pairing with Dragapult in particular, as Dragapult is capable of spreading status effects to a multitude of Pokemon such as Great Tusk and Landorus-T for Skeledirge to take advantage of with its Hex, as well as handling faster threats such as Roaring Moon and Iron Boulder.</p>"

Earthquake lets Garganacl hit threats such as Gholdengo, Raging Bolt, and Galarian Slowking, with its high-Base Power giving Garganacl offensive presence so it doesn't have to rely solely on Salt Cure for damage, which is especially useful since Raging Bolt commonly runs Leftovers and Galarian Slowking's Regenerator can mitigate Salt Cure damage as well. 52 Defense EVs lets Garganacl survive Ogerpon-W's Power Whip as well as +1 Protosynthesis-boosted Roaring Moon's Earthquake without the need for Curse boosts or Terastallization. Tera Water turns Garganacl's Water weakness into a resistance, letting it better handle Water-types such as Barraskewda and Hisuian Samurott. It also lets Garganacl check offensive Steel-types such as Gholdengo, with Purifying Salt letting it resist Shadow Ball. On the other hand, Tera Fairy gives Garganacl an immunity to Draco Meteor from Dragapult as well as Dragon Pulse from Raging Bolt, in addition to giving it a resistance to Knock Off from the likes of Roaring Moon. It also grants Garganacl a resistance to Fighting-type moves from Pokemon such as Zamazenta and Great Tusk and removes its Grass weakness, improving its matchup against Meowscarada. Both options remove Garganacl's weakness to Ground-type moves, letting it better handle Dragon-types that rely on Earthquake for coverage such as Dragonite and Roaring Moon.</p> <p>Garganacl fits well on bulky offense or balance teams. Due to not running Heavy-Duty Boots, Garganacl appreciates entry hazard removal from the likes of Great Tusk and Corviknight; Great Tusk in particular appreciates Garganacl checking spinblockers such as Dragapult and, with Tera Water, Gholdengo. Rillaboom makes for a great partner thanks to Garganacl appreciating the recovery from Grassy Terrain, which alleviates entry hazard chip damage, as well as the reduction in Earthquake's damage, letting it check Pokemon like Roaring Moon better. It should be noted that Garganacl's own Earthquake will deal less damage as a result of Grassy Terrain and Salt Cure's chip damage will be mitigated by Grassy Terrain's healing when combined with Leftovers, however. As Substitute blocks Salt Cure, Pokemon that can punish the use of the move, such as Encore Dragonite, Infiltrator Dragapult, and Whirlwind Ting-Lu, are appreciated teammates. Ogerpon-W makes for a great partner with Garganacl thanks to Water Absorb and its ability to force Ground-types like Gliscor out with Ivy Cudgel. It can also punish Substitute with Encore and remove items like Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off, accentuating the chip damage done by Salt Cure. In exchange, it appreciates Garganacl deterring defensive Pokemon like Skarmory with Salt Cure, as well as its ability to handle Dragon-types like Dragonite and Dragapult. Unaware Clefable forms a good defensive core with Garganacl, denying other setup sweepers the opportunity to set up on Garganacl while also appreciating its ability to absorb status from Pokemon like Galarian Slowking, Dragapult and Skeledirge. Garganacl also benefits from Clefable's ability to check Ting-Lu. Opposing Clefable can check Garganacl with both of its abilities, so Pokemon that can dispatch it, like Gholdengo and Heatran, make for good partners. Garganacl also enjoys Knock Off and hazard support, as the removal of items like Heavy-Duty Boots and the additional chip from hazards makes it harder to play around due to the chip damage from Salt Cure having more of an impact on Pokemon like Galarian Slowking, Alomomola, and Ting-Lu. Gliscor has access to Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Knock Off while also resisting Ground-type moves; in exchange, Garganacl checks Hex Dragapult, one of Gliscor's best checks. Finally, specially defensive Pokemon such as Galarian Slowking and Clodsire appreciate Garganacl's physical walling capabilities while making up for its inability to consistently handle special attackers like Primarina and Enamorus.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Garganacl is an exceptional Stealth Rock setter and wall thanks to its great bulk, amazing ability in Purifying Salt, and access to Salt Cure. As a setter, Garganacl is very good at outlasting and pressuring common removal options like non-Leftovers Great Tusk, Corviknight, and Iron Treads with Salt Cure. Protect also stalls turns, which works well in conjunction with Salt Cure and allows Garganacl to chip its foes as much as possible; it's also useful at scouting moves from foes such as Choice Band Roaring Moon, Rillaboom, and Meowscarada and maximizing passive recovery from Leftovers. 52 Defense EVs allow Garganacl to survive Ogerpon-W's Power Whip and +1 Protosynthesis Roaring Moon's Earthquake, and the rest of the EVs are invested in HP and Special Defense to maximize its special bulk to help it take on threats such as Dragapult in a better fashion. Tera Fairy enables it to handle threats such as Zamazenta, Great Tusk, Roaring Moon, and Dragapult better; in addition, the Grass neutrality helps it against foes like Rillaboom, Ogerpon-W, and Meowscarada. Tera Water helps it against foes like Gholdengo and Water-types like Barraskewda and Hisuian Samurott. Both of these Tera types are useful at handling non-Swords Dance Gliscor as well, as Garganacl also acts as a Toxic absorber.</p> <p>Garganacl fits well on bulky offense and balance teams that need a bulky entry hazard setter; Salt Cure is great at making progress for its teammates to capitalize on. Setup sweepers such as Kingambit, Weavile, and Nasty Plot Gholdengo appreciate Garganacl's ability to chip and force damage on the opposing team with Stealth Rock and Salt Cure, especially against threats such as Skarmory and Primarina. In return, they offensively pressure Garganacl's switch-ins such as Galarian Slowking, Rillaboom, and Clefable, as it's reliant on Salt Cure for damage and is thus very passive. Gholdengo also deserves a special mention because of its ability to block hazard removal attempts from foes like Great Tusk and Corviknight. Garganacl also forms amazing cores with Spikes setters such as Gliscor, Hisuian Samurott, and Skarmory, further helping its offensive teammates by dominating the hazard game. Moreover, Gliscor and Skarmory also help it in checking Ground- and Fighting-types like Landorus-T and Zamazenta. Knock Off users such as Clefable and the aforementioned Weavile are also good teammates due to removing Heavy-Duty Boots from foes such as Galarian Slowking and Dondozo; removing Leftovers from foes like Zamazenta and Ting-Lu is also useful so that they take maximum damage from Salt Cure and Stealth Rock. In addition, Clefable and the aforementioned Gliscor also support Garganacl by acting as Knock Off absorbers, as Garganacl likes to keep its Leftovers intact—Protect and Leftovers form a strong combination that makes Garganacl very tough to break down. Galarian Slowking also makes a great partner that supports Garganacl with Future Sight, punishing Fighting-types such as Zamazenta and Iron Valiant, as well as providing pivoting support with Chilly Reception. Garganacl also appreciates hazard removal support, as its foes such as Gliscor, Clefable, and Ting-Lu may use it as fodder for setting up hazards, especially Spikes; as such, Pokemon like Great Tusk make nice teammates. Due to its relatively poor base typing, Garganacl is weak to a variety of threats including Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, Kingambit, and Ogerpon-W; thus, partners such as Ogerpon-W, Skeledirge, Zamazenta, and Dragapult, respectively, are appreciated. Rillaboom also synergizes well with Garganacl, as its Grassy Terrain can weaken Earthquake from foes like Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, and Gliscor for Garganacl as well as helping it deal with Pokemon like Ogerpon-W and Barraskewda; in return, Garganacl supports Rillaboom with hazard and deals with foes like Iron Moth for it.</p>"

Early in the game, Tinkaton makes for a good anti-lead, matching up well into other entry hazard setters like Clefable, Deoxys-S, and Ribombee and disrupting them with Encore while setting its own entry hazards. Encore also works well with Gigaton Hammer, allowing Tinkaton to punish foes that would take advantage of the passivity after the latter move is used to set up or recover HP. Thunder Wave can be run to punish Pokemon like Iron Moth and Ogerpon-W switching into Tinkaton, while Knock Off can be used instead to cripple foes like Moltres, Galarian Slowking, and Dragapult by removing their Heavy-Duty Boots. Air Balloon bypasses its Groud weakness against foes like Gliscor and Landorus-T, and it allows Tinkaton to check threats like Roaring Moon, Kyurem, Dragonite, and Enamorus that rely on their Ground coverage to deal with Steel-types. Pickpocket also allows Tinkaton to disrupt foes by stealing their item once its Air Balloon is popped, notably against U-turn users like Landorus-T and Dragapult that can pop Tinkaton's Air Balloon and lose their own item in the same turn. Mold Breaker can be used instead to let Tinkaton paralyze Gholdengo and Garganacl with Thunder Wave, set Stealth Rock against Hatterene, and even use Encore on all three of them. Tinkaton can utilize Tera Water to get rid of its Fire weakness, standing up to the likes of Cinderace and Iron Moth. Tinkaton can use the turn it Terastallizes to lock them into newly resisted Fire-type attacks or threaten back with Thunder Wave or Knock Off. Tera Ghost can instead block Rapid Spin from Great Tusk and Iron Treads. 232 Speed EVs allow Tinkaton to outspeed Landorus-T.</p> <p>Tinkaton fits well on balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate its ability to disrupt opposing Pokemon and set entry hazards, as well as its ability to switch into moves from Pokemon like Darkrai and Dragapult. It can form a hazard stacking core with Spikes setters like Gliscor and Hisuian Samurott while also benefitting from their ability to handle Ground-types and use Knock Off. Tinkaton struggles to do damage in spite of Gigaton Hammer's Base Power due to its middling Attack stat, so it needs offensive partners like Dragonite and Kyurem, which, in return, appreciate Tinkaton being able to check Weavile and Deoxys-S. Tinkaton also won't keep its Air Balloon forever, so it needs Ground-immune teammates like Moltres and Zapdos that can handle the likes of Great Tusk and Landorus-T. Great Tusk is also an excellent teammate for Tinkaton, providing entry hazard removal, since Tinkaton lacks recovery unless it steals another Pokemon's Leftovers, and taking care Fire-types like Cinderace and certain Ground-types like Ting-Lu. Gholdengo is notably annoying for Tinkaton, as it resists Gigaton Hammer and is immune to both Thunder Wave and Encore if Tinkaton is not running Mold Breaker, so teammates like Darkrai and Roaring Moon that can remove it are a big help.</p>"

Toxic Debris's potential to set up Toxic Spikes can prove lethal against certain teams, particularly more offensive ones due to the lack of offensive Poison-types in OU outside of Iron Moth able to absorb them. Mortal Spin's side effect of inflicting poison detracts Pokemon such as Ting-Lu from setting up entry hazards multiple times and Hatterene from trying to deny Stealth Rock with Magic Bounce. Power Gem lets Glimmora hit most targets for decent damage, and notably chips at Corviknight, Skarmory, and Gliscor that would otherwise wall Glimmora, with Corviknight also removing its entry hazards with Defog. Earth Power allows Glimmora to hit Steel-types such as Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Heatran, which otherwise are able to block Mortal Spin, with the former two also resisting Power Gem. Mud Shot is another option over Earth Power, as its side effect of lowering the foe's Speed allows Glimmora to win the mirror matchup against opposing Glimmora. Mud Shot can also slow down foes trying to use Glimmora as setup fodder, such as Iron Valiant and Roaring Moon, preventing them from getting out of hand. Focus Sash allows Glimmora to survive any one hit and thus be able to set up Stealth Rock safely. Red Card can be used instead, allowing Glimmora to make use of its natural bulk and typing to take a hit and thus phaze setup sweepers like Iron Valiant and Iron Moth—which is notable in the hyper offense mirror—preventing its team from getting overrun by boosted offensive threats. Red Card is also useful to disrupt the opposing team, potentially forcing a foe out to take Stealth Rock or Toxic Spikes damage. Tera Ghost grants Glimmora with an immunity to Rapid Spin from the likes of Great Tusk and Iron Treads, denying their attempts from removing Glimmora's entry hazards.</p> <p>Glimmora finds its home on hyper offense teams that enjoy it starting the match strong by setting up Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes from the beginning. Kingambit greatly appreciates this, as even Pokemon that resist Sucker Punch like Roaring Moon and Enamorus can potentially get KOed by +2 Sucker Punch after a round or two of Stealth Rock, while physically defensive walls trying to switch in like Skarmory and Corviknight have to contend with not only Kingambit's attacks but also with the chip damage from Stealth Rock. Roaring Moon and Iron Valiant similarly enjoy Glimmora's entry hazards chipping at the foes for them and the rest of the team to win late-game, while they also provide Knock Off support to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Dondozo, Alomomola, and Clodsire, making them susceptible to its hazards. Gholdengo may be used alongside Glimmora, as its Ghost typing and Good as Gold ability let it block Rapid Spin and Defog attempts, thus making sure Glimmora's entry hazards stay up. Glimmora may also play a defensive role on occasion, as its good matchup against Skeledirge lets it assist teammates like Iron Moth and Zamazenta that can struggle against it.</p>"

Meteor Beam helps Glimmora power through the likes of Corviknight, Garganacl, and Galarian Slowking. Meteor Beam can also surprise a common switch-in, Air Balloon Gholdengo, as it cannot take a Meteor Beam on switch-in followed by a boosted Earth Power. Sludge Wave hits Fairy-types such as Hatterene, Iron Valiant, and Primarina and most neutral targets other than Blissey. Steel-types like Kingambit and Heatran can take Glimmora's STAB moves, so Earth Power provides excellent coverage for them as well as opposing Glimmora, Raging Bolt, and Skeledirge after its Power Herb has been consumed. Gholdengo, even with Air Balloon, cannot reliably switch into a Meteor Beam into Earth Power. In the last slot, Glimmora can run Dazzling Gleam to reliably hit the Dragon-types such as Dragapult and Roaring Moon once Glimmora's Power Herb has been consumed. Optionally, Glimmora can also run Tera Fairy to power up Dazzling Gleam and gain a better defensive typing to deal with faster attackers like Dragapult and Darkrai, as well as gaining a neutrality to Ground to take Roaring Moon's Earthquake in a pinch. Rock Polish is another option that makes up for Glimmora's lackluster Speed tier, allowing it to outspeed notable threats such as Iron Valiant and Roaring Moon after one use. Finally, Power Gem gives Glimmora a reliable Rock-type STAB move after Power Herb has been consumed. Aside from gaining a resistance to Rillaboom's Grassy Glide, both Tera Grass and Tera Flying give it an immunity and a resistance to Ground, respectively, with Tera Flying having the drawback of being weak to priority Thunderclap from Raging Bolt. Tera Grass also provides Glimmora with better Ogerpon-W and Great Tusk matchups.</p> <p>This set primarily fits on hyper offense teams, especially Sticky Web teams where Glimmora's lackluster Speed is made up for. As such, Sticky Web setters like Ribombee are fantastic partners. Glimmora excels against opposing offense, as many opposing offense teams struggle with Toxic Spikes, meaning the opponent must be careful with how they attack Glimmora. This careful play can be punished by breaking through common bulkier threats that fit well on offense, such as Zamazenta and Gholdengo. Glimmora struggles against bulkier teams that make use of Heavy-Duty Boots; as such, Glimmora appreciates the presence of powerful wallbreakers and Knock Off users, such as Iron Valiant, Ogerpon-W, and Roaring Moon. Sturdy special walls such as Blissey, Ting-Lu, and Clodsire also give Glimmora trouble, so it appreciates other entry hazards to wear them down over time, which foes like Landorus-T and Hisuian Samurott can provide. Hisuian Samurott can also provide Knock Off support to get rid of their Heavy-Duty Boots. Gholdengo is also a great partner, as it can block hazard removal to keep Glimmora's Toxic Spikes up; it also provides good defensive utility by checking Galarian Slowking. Kingambit is a great offensive partner that can take advantage of the Toxic Spikes that Glimmora sets up and clean up late-game after Glimmora has broken through the opposing team.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With massive physical bulk and Unaware, Dondozo is a robust physical wall that is capable of checking some of the tier's most prevalent threats, such as Great Tusk, Roaring Moon, and Kingambit. Waterfall is Dondozo's STAB move of choice, with high PP and lack of a drawback, and does decent damage to potential switch-ins like Gholdengo and Iron Valiant looking to scare Dondozo out, while Body Press can instead more effectively handle the likes of Kingambit and Roaring Moon and let Dondozo hit Ogerpon-W. Curse can make Dondozo a potent threat, increasing both its offensive potential and defensive capabilities, including letting it better check potent threats like Tera Dark Kingambit. Avalanche can be run instead to 2HKO Tera Flying Roaring Moon, also able to punish Grass-types like Rillaboom and Serperior that might otherwise fearlessly switch into Dondozo. RestTalk helps Dondozo stay healthy and avoid status while potentially continuing to make progress or set up, depending on the Sleep Talk rolls. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Dondozo switch safely into powerful attackers repeatedly without taking entry hazard damage, while Leftovers can be used instead to provide more reliable recovery than Rest. Tera Fighting powers up Dondozo's Body Press, allowing it to get more mileage out of its naturally high Defense and Curse boosts, and lets it more effectively check Kingambit thanks to the Dark resistance it provides; Tera Dark can help Dondozo check special attackers like Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Stored Power Latias in a pinch as well as non-Low Kick Kingambit variants; and Tera Grass can be used to flip its weaknesses, letting it resist normally dangerous attacks from Rillaboom and Serperior and effectively check Ogerpon-W, which can give bulkier teams trouble.</p> <p>Dondozo is generally found on bulkier teams that appreciate its ability to easily check a number of threatening setup sweepers and other fearsome physical attackers like Kingambit. Despite its enormous physical bulk, Dondozo's special bulk leaves much to be desired, so it pairs well with specially defensive walls like Blissey and Clodsire that can handle Pokemon like Raging Bolt. Dondozo is a passive Pokemon that is checked by other bulky Pokemon like Alomomola, which can also use it as fodder to pass Wishes to Pokemon like Ursaluna, and Clefable, and so it benefits from teammates like Gliscor and Clefable that have more offensive presence and can make progress against them or act as Knock Off absorbers for it. On balance teams, offensive partners like Great Tusk and Weavile help threaten Dondozo's checks like Rillaboom and Raging Bolt while in turn benefitting from its ability to check Kingambit. Ogerpon-W is particularly annoying for Dondozo thanks to Water Absorb and is difficult to check without using Tera, so teammates like Amoonguss and Hydrapple that can handle it while also helping against threats like Rillaboom are appreciated, though the latter loses to Play Rough variants. If Dondozo runs Leftovers, entry hazard removers like Talonflame, which can threaten Defog against Gholdengo, and Corviknight are necessary partners to keep Dondozo healthy through repeated switches while also doubling as checks to Rillaboom and Meowscarada. Alomomola is a great partner for passing Wish to Dondozo, helping it be less reliant on Rest for recovery as well as potentially burning physical threats like Roaring Moon and Weavile to help it take as little damage as possible from stronger physical attackers.</p>"

        "description": "<p>With high special bulk, a useful typing, and an excellent ability in Unaware, Clodsire is one of the best special walls in OU, checking threats like Raging Bolt, Darkrai, and Iron Moth. Although Earthquake is its preferred STAB move, Bulldoze trades power for greater PP, allowing Clodsire to continually chip away at Pokemon like Gholdengo and Clefable during longer games. Similarly, Poison Jab trades the reliable status of Toxic for greater PP and actual damage, as well as offering a way for Clodsire to spread status while Taunted and against Pokemon with Magic Bounce, valuable against threats like Enamorus, Hatterene, and Raging Bolt. A niche alternative is Poison Sting, which trades some power for even higher PP, useful for stalling out Latias, and a lack of contact, useful against Pokemon like Rocky Helmet Landorus-T and Flame Body Moltres. For its last moveslot, Clodsire can choose between Spikes or Stealth Rock as its entry hazard, as its special bulk allows it many opportunities to lay hazards after checking a threat. However, teams that already have both hazards prefer Amnesia, which bolsters Clodsire's Special Defense to staggering heights, ensuring powerful special attackers like Raging Bolt and Gholdengo or Stored Power users like Latias and Hatterene cannot break through. For Tera types, Clodsire can choose between Tera Steel and Dark. Tera Steel allows Clodsire to keep its valuable Toxic immunity while still giving it valuable resistances that allow it to check foes like Psyshock Gholdengo, Primarina, and Walking Wake. Alternatively, Tera Dark gives Clodsire a Psychic immunity, crucial for checking Stored Power, Psychic Noise, Future Sight, and Psyshock users like Latias, Galarian Slowking, and Hatterene.</p> <p>Due to Clodsire's passive nature, it slots best onto stall and bulkier balance teams, which appreciate the defensive capabilities it brings. Teammates like Dondozo and Alomomola appreciate Clodsire's ability to check threatening sweepers like Raging Bolt, while Clodsire can rely on them to check physical attackers like Great Tusk and Landorus-T. Another teammate that Clodsire pairs especially well with is Blissey, as together they form an extremely potent defensive core that can wall almost any special attacker. Clodsire covers threats like Serperior and Gholdengo that can boost past Blissey's sheer bulk, while Blissey beats special attackers like Primarina, Iron Crown, and Walking Wake that can hit Clodsire for super effective damage. Gliscor and Clefable can serve as Knock Off absorbers, as well as setting entry hazards, allowing Clodsire to run Amnesia. On bulkier balance teams, Clodsire pairs well with Skarmory as the defensive backbone of the team, setting hazards and forcing switches to chip down offensive threats like Great Tusk, Darkrai, and especially Gliscor, which Clodsire is completely helpless against. Corviknight also excels as a partner, absorbing Knock Off that can cripple Clodsire, as well as beating Gliscor, Skarmory, and opposing Corviknight, all of which Clodsire struggles against. Garganacl can soak up status from threats like Hex Dragapult and Cinderace while providing physical bulk that Clodsire appreciates. Offensive partners like Dragapult and Zamazenta threaten Pokemon that Clodsire can't handle such as Walking Wake, while Clodsire walls threats like Iron Valiant and Enamorus that its partners would otherwise struggle against. Another good teammate is Kingambit, which can absorb Future Sight and other Psychic-type attacks that would threaten Clodsire, while Clodsire beats Pokemon that Kingambit struggles against, like Raging Bolt, Moltres, and Iron Moth.</p>"

  "Kingambit": {
    "sets": {
      "Offensive Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Kingambit is the premier offensive Pokemon in OU, with potent wallbreaking and sweeping potential thanks to its high Attack bolstered by Supreme Overlord and Swords Dance. It has excellent natural bulk and the ability to Terastallize to either maximize damage output or gain defensive advantages against its checks. Its strong Sucker Punch makes it one of the best anti-offense tools in the metagame. Kingambit can use Kowtow Cleave for a more consistent Dark-type attack than Sucker Punch. Iron Head gives coverage against Dark-resistant Pokemon, notably Clefable, Great Tusk, and Zamazenta. Low Kick can be used over Kowtow Cleave or Iron Head to beat opposing Kingambit, although dropping Iron Head for Low Kick leaves Kingambit walled by Fairy-types, while dropping Kowtow Cleave leaves Kingambit walled by Skeledirge and Toxapex and stuck with the less reliable Sucker Punch as its only Dark-type move. Kingambit's item slot is very flexible depending on the needs of the team; Black Glasses is the best item on Kingambit to stack with Supreme Overlord and potentially Tera Dark; Air Balloon can be used to gain setup opportunities on Ground-types like Great Tusk, Gliscor, and Landorus-T; Lum Berry is an option to absorb otherwise crippling status from Pokemon like Galarian Slowking, Dragapult, and Cinderace; and Heavy-Duty Boots is an option on teams with either no or unreliable entry hazard control to keep Kingambit from being worn down by Spikes early-game. Tera Dark powers up Sucker Punch and Kowtow Cleave while removing Kingambit's weaknesses to Fire- and Ground-type moves. In combination with Black Glasses and +2 Attack, it allows Kingambit's Kowtow Cleave to OHKO physical walls such as Alomomola, Gliscor, and Garganacl. Additionally, Kowtow Cleave 2HKOes Dondozo, while +2 Sucker Punch OHKOes Roaring Moon, opposing offensive Kingambit after Spikes, and Hisuian Samurott. Tera Ghost completely nullifies its severe Fighting weakness, most notably letting it overwhelm a otherwise decent checks in IronPress Skarmory and Zamazenta one-on-one. Aside from granting a Fire resistance, Tera Fire most importantly prevents Kingambit from being crippled by Flame Body and Will-O-Wisp from Pokemon like Moltres, Heatran, Dragapult, and Cinderace, especially for non-Lum Berry variants. Tera Flying can be used for its Ground immunity while still letting Kingambit shrug off Fighting-type moves, which helps against checks like Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Zamazenta. Alternatively, Tera Fighting can be used with Low Kick to always OHKO defensive Great Tusk at +2 with five Supreme Overlord boosts and a layer of Spikes, and it can 3HKO Dondozo with five Supreme Overlord boosts. An Adamant nature is preferred to maximize the power of Sucker Punch to break through bulky Pokemon. Jolly can be run over Adamant to win the Low Kick Kingambit mirror matchup against Adamant variants and outspeed some variants of IronPress Skarmory and Corviknight before they can boost Defense. However, the power drop from losing out on Adamant limits Kingambit in all other matchups, especially when Sucker Punch nullifies Adamant's speed drop anyway; Jolly Kingambit cannot OHKO Dragapult with Sucker Punch unboosted, and even with five Supreme Overlord boosts, it cannot 3HKO Dondozo without Black Glasses or Tera Dark.</p> <p>Kingambit fits on offensive and bulky offense teams that appreciate its defensive profile and capabilities as a revenge killer and late-game sweeper, being able to defensively check non-Focus Blast Gholdengo, Choice Specs Dragapult, Meowscarada, and Weavile without Low Kick. Offensively, Kingambit can revenge kill a wide range of Pokemon, including Deoxys-S and Dragapult while also being able to revenge kill anything without Substitute, Encore, or strong neutral priority, given enough chip damage. Roaring Moon is an excellent partner for Kingambit, overloading Dark-resistant foes and physical walls for each other and paving the way for one of them to break through and end the game. On bulky offense teams, Spikes setters like Skarmory and Gliscor synergize well with Kingambit. Spikes Gliscor in particular provides a highly valuable and resilient Ground immunity and Fighting resistance, and its Toxic also synergizes with Sucker Punch, helping to ease prediction by putting opposing Pokemon on a turn limit. On offensive teams, hazard setters such as Glimmora, Deoxys-S, and Hisuian Samurott help Kingambit break through foes that resist its moves, especially Great Tusk variants without Heavy-Duty Boots, which can be forced to take hazard chip early on. Kingambit can also be used alongside dual screens Deoxys-S and Alolan Ninetales, making it easier to set up and providing a highly valuable Dragapult check to the dual screens team. Rillaboom can support Kingambit with Grassy Surge, giving it easier setup opportunities with extra HP and weakening Earthquake from Gliscor, Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Ting-Lu. Rillaboom can also switch into Ogerpon-W, Great Tusk, and Dondozo and remove Rocky Helmet from Skarmory and Corviknight with Knock Off. Galarian Slowking appreciates Kingambit resisting Ghost- and Dark-type attacks aimed at it. In return, it supports Kingambit with Future Sight to break through Great Tusk, Zamazenta, Dondozo, Alomomola, and Skarmory while also switching into Iron Valiant, Enamorus, and Zamazenta for Kingambit. Gholdengo is a great teammate for Kingambit, being able to handle threats like Iron Valiant, Zamazenta, Skarmory, Corviknight, Substitute Iron Boulder, and Dondozo while checking Rillaboom and Dragonite, which can punish its Sucker Punch with priority. It also softens opposing teams for Kingambit to finish off using Gholdengo's own wallbreaking capabilities and excellence in keeping entry hazards on the field.</p>"

      "Bulky Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>By investing in bulk, Kingambit gains more setup opportunities and the ability to act as a short-term blanket check for much of the metagame; it also is an effective late-game cleaner. Kingambit can be used to absorb hits throughout the game from Pokemon like Dragapult, as well as Gholdengo and Weavile if they aren't running Fighting-type coverage. Iron Head destroys many of the Fairy-types in the tier, including Enamorus, Clefable, and Hatterene. Tera Blast Fairy is a surprising pick that can take on bulky Fighting-types, including Great Tusk and Zamazenta. Low Kick provides solid coverage for opposing Kingambit as well as maintaining a strong option into Pokemon like Roaring Moon and Ting-Lu. However, without Iron Head, Kingambit struggles with the matchup against Fairy-types. Kingambit makes good use of both Leftovers to increase its longevity late-game and Heavy-Duty Boots to avoid entry hazard damage and continue switching in to keep pressure on. Tera Flying gives Kingambit a resistance to Fighting and an immunity to Ground, allowing it to set up on Great Tusk and Landorus-T, whereas Tera Fairy not only assists Kingambit defensively by giving it a Fighting resistance and a good defensive spread but also gives it access to Tera Blast Fairy to add to its coverage. 44 Speed EVs make Kingambit faster than Blissey, and the remaining 212 EVs not invested in Attack are put into HP, increasing its bulk. Alternatively, Kingambit's HP EVs can be raised to increase bulk, dropping Speed down to 4 EVs, which outruns uninvested Iron Hands, Ursaluna, and Azumarill.</p> <p>Bulky Kingambit is excellent on offense and balance teams as both a powerful late game setup sweeper and a form of speed control. Alongside more passive bulky Pokemon, such as Gliscor and Skarmory, Kingambit helps the team make more progress and break through tougher threats; in return, they can chip down Great Tusk with Toxic or Rocky Helmet damage. These Pokemon also set up entry hazards, which assist with wallbreaking. Slower teams appreciate the priority Kingambit provides, and Pokemon like Gholdengo also appreciate Kingambit's ability to switch into Dragon- and Ghost-type attacks from Dragapult and opposing Gholdengo. Great Tusk can weaken Gliscor, Landorus-T, and opposing Great Tusk for Kingambit while also being able to remove Skarmory's Rocky Helmet with Knock Off. In return, Great Tusk appreciates bulky Kingambit being able to switch in on Pokemon like Hatterene and Clefable that force Great Tusk out. Kingambit benefits from teammates with the ability to pivot and get it in safely, such as Meowscarada and Galarian Slowking. Galarian Slowking also supports Kingambit by setting up Future Sight, which is difficult for foes to switch in on at the same time as Kowtow Cleave, as it forces special and physical damage on the same turn; only Dark-types resist both, and they struggle to take Kingambit's coverage moves. Kingambit in turn helps Galarian Slowking by resisting Dark and Ghost and switching in on Gholdengo and Dragapult. Kingambit can form a Dark-type spam core with Roaring Moon or Weavile, as they can assist in beating down Dondozo, Skarmory, and Great Tusk. Rillaboom helps Kingambit by removing its Earthquake weakness and providing passive recovery from Grassy Terrain. Due to its lower special bulk, Kingambit can be vulnerable to wallbreakers like Raging Bolt and Walking Wake. Having teammates more suited to taking hits from such Pokemon, like Galarian Slowking and Toxapex, is a good solution. Combining Kingambit's power with the power of Pokemon like Iron Valiant and Gholdengo is another way to boost a team's wallbreaking potential. Gholdengo's ability allows it to keep hazards up, helping Kingambit keep pressure up. Both Pokemon defensively check Pokemon that threaten the other; Gholdengo checks Fighting-types like Iron Valiant and Zamazenta, while Kingambit checks Ghost-types like Dragapult and other Gholdengo. Iron Valiant and Kingambit both have powerful speed control and support each other by weakening their shared checks, like Gliscor and Moltres. Kingambit is also useful against Galarian Slowking and Gholdengo, which Iron Valiant forces in.</p>"

      "Offensive Bulk Up": {
        "description": "<p>Bulk Up Great Tusk with Booster Energy's Speed boost is a potent physical setup sweeper that is capable of providing valuable utility to its team, as its access to Rapid Spin and its natural bulk allows it to check key threats such as Dragonite and Kingambit. Bulk Up leverages Great Tusk's natural bulk to give it setup opportunities against many of the common physical attackers in the tier, such as Kingambit and Zamazenta. Headlong Rush is a brutally powerful option for a Ground-type STAB move and is not weakened by Grassy Terrain. Alternatively, Earthquake can be run if Headlong Rush's low PP and Defense drops prove to be problematic, but misses out on benchmarks like the potential OHKO on Dragapult and Iron Valiant at +1. Ice Spinner allows Great Tusk to hit Grass- and Flying-types such as Serperior, Gliscor, and Enamorus for super effective damage, which would otherwise wall it or force it out. The last moveslot can be Rapid Spin, which lets it remove hazards and provides it with further boosts to its Speed, preventing otherwise faster threats like Deoxys-S and Booster Energy Iron Valiant from revenge killing it; Close Combat for a strong Fighting-type STAB move, guaranteeing the OHKO on bulky Kingambit, threatening huge damage on Ting-Lu, and punishing switch-ins like Skarmory and Corviknight with heavy damage; or Knock Off, which deals with Air Balloon Gholdengo as well as crippling its checks like Dondozo. The EV spread listed is necessary for Great Tusk to attain a Speed boost from Protosynthesis from Booster Energy; however, Leftovers can be used instead should Great Tusk be used on sun. Tera Poison is the premier defensive Tera type for Great Tusk, allowing it to set up on Gliscor's Toxic and completely wall Rillaboom and Zamazenta alongside avoiding a KO and thus granting it an extra turn against Iron Valiant and Enamorus. Conversely, Tera Ice is a strong choice for an offensive Tera type that provides Great Tusk with STAB on Ice Spinner, which can net OHKOs on Gliscor and offensive Zapdos after a boost from Bulk Up. Tera Steel can also be considered as an alternative to Tera Poison that also lets Great Tusk wall Choice Band Dragapult and Dragon Dance Kyurem, at the cost of being weaker into Cinderace, Zamazenta, and Low Kick Kingambit. Additionally, both Tera Ice and Steel provides an Ice resistance against foes like Weavile and Meowscarada.</p> <p>Great Tusk is commonly seen on offense, hyper offense, and sun structures, which appreciate its entry hazard control and ability to clean teams in late-game scenarios. Great Tusk particularly struggles against physical walls such as Skarmory, Corviknight, and Dondozo. On sun teams, strong special attackers such as Raging Bolt and Walking Wake can easily force these Pokemon out and can soften up the opposing team for Great Tusk to sweep in the mid- or late-game. In return, Great Tusk provides key hazard control and switches into powerful physical threats such as Kingambit. Additionally, it can easily shatter common checks to both Walking Wake and Raging Bolt, particularly Clodsire and Galarian Slowking. Hatterene on sun teams and Choice Scarf Enamorus on weatherless offense can support Great Tusk with Healing Wish and can threaten some of its checks, notably Gliscor, Deoxys-S, and Zamazenta. Hatterene also alleviates the need for Great Tusk to run Rapid Spin, freeing up the last moveslot for more offensively oriented options such as Close Combat and Knock Off. Outside of sun, Rillaboom provides Great Tusk with passive recovery without relying on Leftovers and can force out or KO the likes of Primarina and Dondozo. In return, Great Tusk can act as a mid- or late-game sweeper once the opposing team is sufficiently weakened and can threaten Pokemon such as Dragonite that Rillaboom struggles against. Dragonite appreciates the utility of Great Tusk's Rapid Spin and its ability to consistently threaten Skeledirge. In exchange, Dragonite can handle opposing Ogerpon-W. Lastly, Kingambit enjoys having Great Tusk beating its checks like opposing Great Tusk one-to-one with its own setup, allowing it to more easily sweep late-game.</p>"

      "Offensive Utility": {
        "description": "<p>Great Tusk is a great Pokemon in the OU metagame due to its role compression, entry hazard removal, offensive and defensive typing, and bulk, enabling it to check a variety of top-tier threats like Kingambit, Gliscor, and Gholdengo. It is the best hazard remover in the tier and can threaten common hazard setters and spinblockers such as Landorus-T, Glimmora, and Dragapult. Headlong Rush OHKOes offensive Kingambit and is not weakened under Grassy Terrain unlike Earthquake. Do be aware of the drawbacks though; lowering both of Great Tusk's defenses opens it up to an OHKO from Weavile's Triple Axel. Ice Spinner hits Flying-types like Landorus-T and Gliscor and Dragon-types like Dragonite and Hydrapple. Knock Off disrupts foes that switch in and makes progress by removing items like Leftovers and Heavy-Duty Boots. Temper Flare can be used over this to ease prediction against Air Balloon Gholdengo. If it attempts to block Rapid Spin, Temper Flare's power doubles next turn, enabling Great Tusk to OHKO it. Temper Flare also serves as strong coverage in general if used under sun. Rapid Spin provides hazard removal while boosting Great Tusk's Speed. Heavy-Duty Boots makes Great Tusk's job of removing hazards easier, as it ignores the chip damage as well as the Speed drop from Sticky Web, allowing it to switch in more times to make progress. Leftovers is an alternative option, giving Great Tusk healing over time. However, it leaves Great Tusk weak to hazard chip, potentially resulting in it taking massive damage on switch-in and being poisoned. Booster Energy can be used on more offensive teams that care less about longevity, making it easier for Great Tusk to remove hazards thanks to its stronger offensive presence. This EV spread gives it an Attack boost in sun or when running Booster Energy. Tera Ground powers up Headlong Rush, allowing it to OHKO maximum Defense Gholdengo, and it also keeps Great Tusk's Electric immunity. Tera Steel can help Great Tusk check Gliscor by providing it with an immunity to Toxic, and it can 2HKO Gliscor with Ice Spinner without being chipped. Tera Steel gives Great Tusk a multitude of resistances that were prior weaknesses, like Fairy, Psychic, Grass, and Ice, which helps it to check Calm Mind Iron Valiant and Weavile. Tera Fire also gives it notable resistances to Fairy, checking Iron Valiant, and Grass, resisting Rillaboom's Grassy Glide. It also provides a burn immunity, which helps check Cinderace.</p> <p>Great Tusk works well on offensive structures due to its entry hazard removal capabilities, which can help teammates weak to them come in more easily; it also guarantees progress with Knock Off. If used on sun teams, Great Tusk helps support the Stealth Rock-weak Torkoal, enabling it to switch in and set sun more times, as well as being a potent wallbreaker itself with the power boost it gets in the sun. Great Tusk pairs well with Choice-locked wallbreakers and Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon like Enamorus and Kyurem, as they appreciate the hazard removal so they can switch in more reliably. Great Tusk also pairs well with Kingambit, as the hazard removal lets it run Leftovers for more longevity or an offensive item like Black Glasses to hit harder. Ogerpon-W is a good partner for Great Tusk, as it provides a Water immunity and benefits from Great Tusk's hazard removal to switch in more frequently. In return, Great Tusk's Ice Spinner threatens the Dragon-types that Ogerpon-W struggles with. Great Tusk is generally weak to special attackers thanks to its measly Special Defense. Partners like Galarian Slowking, Heatran, and Primarina can patch up this weakness by checking special threats like Iron Valiant, and their typings synergize well with Great Tusk. In return, Great Tusk's hazard removal lets them wall these threats more consistently.</p>"

      "Defensive": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to its gargantuan Defense in tandem with a plethora of utility options and a great defensive typing, Great Tusk makes for a premier defensive presence, checking notable threats like Kingambit and Dragonite. Stealth Rock, in tandem with Rapid Spin, makes Great Tusk a dominant choice for entry hazard control, being able to threaten Pokemon immune to Rapid Spin like Gholdengo and Dragapult with Earthquake or Knock Off while also being able to set up Stealth Rock in the face of aforementioned physical threats. Alternatively, Bulk Up makes Great Tusk more consistently able to check foes like Choice Band Roaring Moon, Iron Boulder, Choice Band Zamazenta, and especially Kingambit. Knock Off punishes common switch ins like Corviknight, Air Balloon Gholdengo, and Zapdos and breaks through Ghost-types like Dragapult. Alternatively, Ice Spinner provides solid coverage for Flying- and Ground-types like Gliscor, Enamorus, and Tera Flying Kingambit. 36 Speed EVs lets Great Tusk outspeed Jolly maximum Speed Kingambit. Tera Water provides Great Tusk means of resisting Water-type attacks from the likes of Barraskewda and Hisuian Samurott while also removing its weaknesses to Fairy and Flying. Alternatively, Tera Steel turns its weaknesses to Grass and Ice into resistances, giving Great Tusk stronger utility against the likes of Meowscarada, Serperior, and Rillaboom. Leftovers gives Great Tusk better longevity, while Heavy-Duty Boots bolsters Great Tusk's role as hazard control.</p> <p>Great Tusk fits best on balance and bulky offense teams as a premier choice for entry hazard control, in addition to acting as a strong check towards the likes of Kingambit and Dragonite. Pokemon that heavily benefit from hazard removal, namely Raging Bolt and Ogerpon-W, heavily appreciate Great Tusk's capability of shedding entry hazards with ease while being able to take advantage of the Water- and Grass-type Pokemon that threaten Great Tusk. Air Balloon Gholdengo poses a major threat to Great Tusk without Knock Off, as it can otherwise switch in with ease and overwhelm Great Tusk with Shadow Ball. As a result, Kingambit makes for a solid partner to Great Tusk thanks to its strong ability to check non-Focus Blast Gholdengo, as well as Serperior, Meowscarada, and Dragapult. Defensive Great Tusk also doubles as a solid Kingambit answer, meaning that Pokemon that would otherwise be overwhelmed by Kingambit such as Dragapult and Gholdengo make for solid partners. The latter also blocks attempts at removing Stealth Rock from the likes of Corviknight and opposing Great Tusk.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Iron Treads serves as a major player in the entry hazard metagame and an excellent lead for offense teams due to its ability to remove hazards from opposing leads like Glimmora and Deoxys-S with Rapid Spin. Its Steel typing blocks Mortal Spin from Glimmora, and it naturally outspeeds Landorus-T, which can use Taunt to prevent hazards from slower leads. Iron Treads can also drop Stealth Rock for Volt Switch, changing its role from a hazard lead to an offensive pivot that can pivot out against Pokemon like Ogerpon-W that otherwise would use it as setup fodder while keeping Rapid Spin utility. Ice Spinner allows Iron Treads to hit Gliscor and Landorus-T, while Iron Head can be used instead to deal with Pokemon like Enamorus, Hatterene, and Tera Fairy Raging Bolt. Iron Treads can also run a specially-based set with Earth Power and either Steel Beam or Volt Switch as its attacks with an EV spread of 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe and a Timid nature; Earth Power allows Iron Treads to KO Glimmora without activating Toxic Debris, while Steel Beam's self-KO allows it to block Rapid Spin from Great Tusk, Defog from Corviknight, and gives safe entry for an incoming teammate. Booster Energy's Speed boost allows Iron Treads to set Stealth Rock against Deoxys-S, grants it more opportunities to use Rapid Spin, and allows it to pick off various otherwise faster Pokemon, notably Cinderace, which could otherwise use Court Change before Iron Treads could attack. Alternatively, Eject Button can be used on teams for additional momentum at the cost of effectiveness in the hazard game. Tera Ghost gives Iron Treads an immunity to Fighting and Normal, blanking Fighting-type moves that would otherwise KO it, including Close Combat from Iron Boulder and Iron Valiant, and preventing Rapid Spin from Great Tusk, opposing Iron Treads, and Torkoal to keep its hazards.</p> <p>Iron Treads is an excellent teammate on offensive teams, such as sun and rain, that can support various sweepers by denying entry hazards, setting its own hazards, or pivoting. It also checks Raging Bolt lacking Weather Ball. Ghost-types like Gholdengo and Dragapult provide Rapid Spin immunities, strengthening the team's advantage in the hazard game, while also checking Iron Defense Zamazenta, a dangerous sweeper that can easily find setup opportunities on Iron Treads. Alongside these Ghost-types, Fairy-, Grass-, and Water-type Pokemon that outspeed Great Tusk including Iron Valiant, Serperior, and Ogerpon-W can be used to prevent Great Tusk from using Rapid Spin without burning Tera, and they also appreciate Iron Treads's ability to keep hazards off the field, as they can't afford to use Heavy-Duty Boots on most teams. Kingambit is also a good teammate, as it is a hyper offense staple and appreciates Iron Treads enabling the offense of its teammates for Kingambit to clean up late-game. Setup sweepers with Knock Off like Roaring Moon, Iron Valiant and Ogerpon-W increase the effectiveness of Stealth Rock by removing items like Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers to assist teammates with breaking through walls such as Dondozo and Garganacl. When using Volt Switch or Eject Button, Iron Treads is excellent on rain teams, checking Raging Bolt and Dragapult and ensuring Pelipper and Barraskewda can pivot in and out freely to use the limited turns of rain are used to the fullest extent. It can also serve a similar role on sun teams, checking Raging Bolt and Glimmora while being able to regain the momentum that Torkoal loses and providing a second hazard remover.</p>"

Hurricane destroys many offensive Pokemon that can take Dark Pulse, including Great Tusk, Iron Valiant, Quaquaval, and Volcarona. Taunt allows Iron Jugulis to function as a dangerous stallbreaker by shutting down passive walls such as Clodsire, Toxapex, and Ting-Lu. It also prevents Slowking from pivoting with Chilly Reception and threats such as Dragonite, Volcarona, Polteageist, and Roaring Moon from setting up. Flamethrower hits Steel-types such as Corviknight, Kingambit, and Iron Treads. Fire Blast trades some of Flamethrower's accuracy for more power, most notably OHKOing the aforementioned Steel-types with Tera Fire. Alternatively, Earth Power OHKOes Iron Moth and lands a stronger hit on Clodsire, Garganacl, Cinderace, Iron Hands, and Toxapex. Tera Dark boosts the power of Dark Pulse, making it easier to pressure walls such as Garganacl, Rotom-W, and Toxapex with its flinch chance. Tera Flying strengthens Hurricane, OHKOing Greninja, Amoonguss, and Cinderace most of the time and 2HKOing Toxapex, Dondozo, and Tera Fairy Skeledirge. Tera Fire strengthens Flamethrower or Fire Blast and gives Iron Jugulis crucial resistances to Iron Valiant's Moonblast.</p> <p>Iron Jugulis is best used on hyper offense teams that appreciate its ability to trouble stall teams and keep fast sweepers in check. Due to its only decent power, Iron Jugulis greatly appreciates entry hazards from teammates such as Glimmora, Greninja, Meowscarada, and Garchomp to wear down its checks. Additionally, Iron Jugulis's Stealth Rock weakness makes entry hazard removers such as Great Tusk and Iron Treads very valuable partners; they can also pressure Clodsire and Iron Moth to free up Iron Jugulis to run a Fire-type move. Powerful wallbreakers such as Breloom and Dragapult can soften up the opposing team for Iron Jugulis to clean up late-game. Conversely, Iron Jugulis's ability to break through special walls with Taunt opens up other special sweepers such as Iron Valiant, Gholdengo, and Iron Moth. Gholdengo can also cripple walls with Choice item + Trick and handle Booster Energy Iron Valiant, one of the only threats capable of outspeeding and threatening Iron Jugulis. Iron Jugulis is also effective on rain teams, providing it with a perfectly-accurate Hurricane and featuring extremely powerful wallbreakers such as Floatzel and Walking Wake that can punch holes for it to sweep late-game. In return, Iron Jugulis threatens Amoonguss and provides a valuable Ghost resistance to take on threats such as Dragapult and Hisuian Zoroark more easily.</p>"

      "Booster Energy": {
        "description": "<p>With titanic Special Attack and superb Speed, Iron Moth is a powerful cleaner and solid wallbreaker that can run away with games after a single Fiery Dance boost while also providing offense with a way to absorb Toxic Spikes from Glimmora. Iron Moth's excellent STAB combination is complemented perfectly by Tera Blast Ground, giving Iron Moth its strongest option against Galarian Slowking and Clodsire while preventing it from being walled by Heatran and Skeledirge. Tera Blast Ghost can also be used to similarly hit Galarian Slowking and Skeledirge while also targetting Dragapult. Alternatively, Dazzling Gleam lets Iron Moth hit Roaring Moon and Dragapult hard while reducing its reliance on Tera for coverage. Energy Ball is another strong coverage option that targets Garganacl and bulky Water-types like Alomomola and Dondozo; both Energy Ball and Dazzling Gleam give Iron Moth strong coverage against Great Tusk and Hisuian Samurott. Substitute helps Iron Moth avoid Kingambit's Sucker Punch and Raging Bolt's Thunderclap while also vastly improving its matchup against Galarian Slowking, whose pivot set is unable to break Iron Moth's Substitute without relying on Future Sight, and Garganacl, which cannot break Iron Moth's Substitute with Salt Cure after it Terastallizes. Iron Moth can instead opt to run a 4 attack set; with Tera Blast Ground and Dazzling Gleam, Iron Moth maximizes its coverage while still hitting Dragon-types like Dragapult and Roaring Moon for super effective damage. Combining Dazzling Gleam and Energy Ball alleviates Iron Moth's reliance on Tera, although this leaves it completely walled by both Heatran and Skeledirge. Psychic is an additional option that can be paired with Dazzling Gleam for coverage that can hit Clodsire for super effective damage without Iron Moth needing to Terastallize, although it still cannot break through Clodsire without it first being significantly weakened. With the given spread, Iron Moth's Booster Energy gives it a Quark Drive boost to its Speed; the remaining EVs maximize its Special Attack while 124 Defense EVs help patch up its poor Defense, allowing it to survive a Sucker Punch from Kingambit with 5 Supreme Overlord boosts and a Close Combat from +2 Iron Valiant. Defensively, Tera Ground gives Iron Moth an immunity to Raging Bolt's Thunderclap and both Galarian Slowking and Dragapult's Thunder Wave. Tera Ghost provides an immunity to Dragonite's Extreme Speed, Blissey's Seismic Toss, and Great Tusk's Rapid Spin in a pinch, and pairs well with Substitute to help mitigate its weakness to Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Tera Fairy powers up Dazzling Gleam into an additional STAB option that OHKOes Dragapult and Hisuian Samurott, along with securing a 2HKO on max HP Zamazenta and Dragonite through Multiscale, while defensively, it provides a resistance to Sucker Punch from Kingambit. Finally, Tera Grass can be used to strengthen Energy Ball, such as nailing the OHKO on both Great Tusk and Hisuian Samurott, while defensively granting Iron Moth a resistance to Ground-type attacks such as Gliscor and Garganacl's Earthquake that can allow it to simply attack or set up a Substitute for free, a quality that is also appreciated against Alomomola.</p> <p>Iron Moth is a great pick for offense and hyper offense teams, not only bringing its qualities as a fast cleaner to the table but also providing teams with a valuable Toxic Spikes absorber. In particular, hyper offense using lead Hisuian Samurott often triggers opposing Glimmora's Toxic Debris; this makes Iron Moth a great partner to Hisuian Samurott while also enabling other Pokemon weak to Toxic Spikes such as Iron Valiant, Roaring Moon, and Iron Defense Zamazenta. In return, Iron Moth greatly appreciates entry hazard support from Pokemon like Hisuian Samurott itself along with Stealth Rock setters like Glimmora and Landorus-T to help weaken Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Assault Vest Galarian Slowking that it struggles to deal with. This highlights one of Iron Moth's shortcomings, as its initial power is not strong enough to break through bulkier walls like Clodsire, Ting-Lu, and Blissey, while without boosts from Fiery Dance, it cannot clean against Pokemon like Landorus-T and Gliscor. Partners like Raging Bolt and Primarina that can weaken or eliminate bulkier targets for Iron Moth are much appreciated, while Iron Valiant provides an alternative form of speed for hyper offense that can also weaken shared checks like Galarian Slowking and Clodsire, a quality particularly useful for Iron Moth lacking Tera Blast Ground. Strong physical attackers such as Roaring Moon and Ogerpon-W make for great partners due to their ability to take advantage of these special walls, using them as opportunities to accrue boosts. Kingambit can also provide an alternative wincon that enjoys Iron Moth threatening checks like Skarmory and weakening targets like Landorus-T, Gliscor, and even Great Tusk that can be forced in to revenge kill it. Iron Moth is great counterplay to Sticky Web teams using Ribombee, which give it two free Fiery Dances from lead; however, Iron Moth is also a good fit on these teams, with support from Sticky Web allowing it to outrun other Booster Energy Pokemon that could otherwise revenge kill it like Iron Valiant and Iron Boulder. Iron Moth also fits on other forms of offense; Rillaboom provides Grassy Terrain support that can let it avoid the OHKO from Gliscor's Earthquake while boosting the power of Energy Ball, and Rillaboom can also bring it in safely with U-turn on passive targets like Skarmory and Corviknight. Meanwhile, Torkoal's sun greatly enhances Iron Moth's wallbreaking power, with sun-boosted Fiery Dances 3HKOing Galarian Slowking. Unfortunately, Iron Moth's frailty is exacerbated by its weakness to entry hazards, and so Great Tusk makes for a strong partner that also appreciates Iron Moth's ability to threaten common switch-ins like Corviknight and Skarmory. Hatterene is another partner that can help keep hazards off the field for Iron Moth, while Hatterene itself is able to help weaken Pokemon like Galarian Slowking and Heatran for Iron Moth to later break through.</p>"

      "Offensive Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<p>Thanks to its ability Good as Gold and excellent defensive typing that lets it set up on Pokemon like Enamorus, Galarian Slowking, and Clefable, Nasty Plot Gholdengo is a premier wallbreaker in SV OU. While Recover gives Gholdengo a way to stay in the battle for longer and leverage its defensive utility against the aforementioned threats, it also has a range of coverage moves to give it more options for wallbreaking. Psyshock is useful for breaking through special walls that would otherwise give Gholdengo trouble, like Blissey and Clodsire, and Focus Blast hits the many Dark-types in the tier, such as Ting-Lu, Hisuian Samurott, and Kingambit. Recover is generally used on bulkier teams, whereas Psyshock and Focus Blast are more useful for teams leaning towards offense. The Ground immunity granted by Air Balloon allows Gholdengo to set up in the face of Gliscor and spinblock Great Tusk in a pinch. Heavy-Duty Boots is another option on teams that lack any entry hazard removal. Gholdengo can make great use of a wide variety of Tera types, both for offensive and defensive purposes: Tera Fairy or Fighting gives it a sudden resistance to Dark, potentially mitigating the damage from moves like Knock Off, Crunch, and Sucker Punch from Iron Valiant, Zamazenta, and Kingambit, respectively. Tera Fairy lacks Tera Fighting's weakness to Fairy, allowing Gholdengo to still serve as a soft check to Iron Valiant and Enamorus in a pinch, whereas Tera Fighting gives Focus Blast an additional STAB boost, allowing +2 Gholdengo to OHKO Ting-Lu after Stealth Rock. Tera Steel can give an additional boost to Make It Rain, granting Gholdengo an OHKO on Speed Booster Energy Great Tusk, as well as lessening the damage of Dark- and Ghost-type attacks from Pokemon like Dragapult.</p> <p>Thanks to Good as Gold, any team can make great use of Gholdengo’s ability to spinblock and prevent Defog, but an offensive team would make the best use of its wallbreaking power. Offensive hazard-stacking cores featuring Pokemon such as Glimmora, Hisuian Samurott, and Deoxys-S can use Gholdengo’s help to keep the pressure on. Powerful Pokemon that take advantage of the switches that Gholdengo forces, like Weavile and Meowscarada with Spikes, as well as other Nasty Plot wallbreakers like Darkrai provide support for Gholdengo to whittle down defensive cores. In addition, other special attackers that have access to utility tools like Knock Off to cripple their shared walls and Pokemon that would otherwise absorb Knock Off, such as Gliscor, Skarmory, Corviknight and Clefable, Darkrai, and Iron Valiant, synergize well with Gholdengo's ability to block all hazard removal. Without using Tera, Gholdengo struggles against the Dark-types that are so common in the tier, such as Kingambit, Roaring Moon, and Hisuian Samurott. Having teammates resistant to Dark-type attacks, like Zamazenta and Enamorus, give Gholdengo some extra protection and a way to strike back against them. Even if it's using Air Balloon, having another Ground-immune Pokemon, such as Gliscor or Tornadus-T, is extremely helpful to mitigate that weakness. Gholdengo’s Speed tier is still slightly lacking when compared to the rest of the OU tier, leaving it vulnerable to fast threats such as Dragapult, Walking Wake, and Weavile. Having some speed control on the team, such as Choice Scarf Enamorus and Meowscarada or priority users like Weavile and Raging Bolt, to counteract these threats is extremely valuable.</p>"
      },
      "Bulky Nasty Plot": {
        "description": "<p>Defensive Gholdengo can serve as a bulky spinblocker and powerful setup sweeper in long matches. Its bulk, typing, and access to reliable recovery give it multiple opportunities to pivot into various defensive Pokemon such as Skarmory, Corviknight, Galarian Slowking, and Clefable and make it a more reliable check to key offensive Pokemon such as Iron Valiant, Hatterene, and Zamazenta. It can use its increased bulk to more safely set up a Nasty Plot while sustaining itself with Recover. Gholdengo possesses near perfect coverage with its STAB attacks, making it very difficult to respond to. Dazzling Gleam is an option over Make It Rain, as it deals high damage to Dark-types such as Hisuian Samurott, Kingambit, and Roaring Moon after a Nasty Plot boost. 60 Speed EVs allow Gholdengo to outspeed Jolly Kingambit and Azumarill, as well as uninvested Landorus-T; alternatively, 92 Speed EVs can allow Gholdengo to also outspeed uninvested Gliscor at the cost of losing a noticeable amount of bulk. Air Balloon allows Gholdengo to avoid taking Spikes damage and Ground-type attacks from prominent Pokemon such as Great Tusk and Gliscor, letting it setup on these Pokemon and more safely pivot into Rapid Spin users such as the aforementioned Great Tusk and Iron Treads. Heavy-Duty Boots can be used instead to more reliably mitigate entry hazard damage and more frequently pivot into various defensive Pokemon such as Skarmory even after it has taken damage. Rocky Helmet is a solid alternative to these items that can effectively punish physical attackers like Zamazenta, which is forced to commit to using Crunch against Gholdengo, and force it out due to the threat of significant chip damage. Gholdengo is a fantastic Terastallization candidate in most matches, as it greatly benefits from neutralizing all of its weaknesses to gain a crucial free turn to setup a Nasty Plot or heal itself with Recover. Tera Fairy gives Gholdengo a better matchup against various Dark-types such as Roaring Moon, Weavile, and Meowscarada and boosts the power of Dazzling Gleam. Tera Water improves Gholdengo's matchups against Iron Moth and Cinderace as well as providing a good defensive typing against much of the metagame. Tera Flying is an alternative option that lets it completely dominate Ground-types such as Great Tusk, Gliscor, and Ting-Lu.</p> <p>Gholdengo fits quite well on bulky offense and balance teams as a spinblocker. Therefore, Spikes setters such as Ting-Lu, Gliscor, and Skarmory, as well as Stealth Rock setters such as Great Tusk, Garganacl, and Landorus-T greatly appreciate Gholdengo's ability to block most forms of hazard removal. Offensive teammates also appreciate Gholdengo's presence due to its strong defensive profile and ability to absorb status moves. Kingambit in particular greatly benefits from Gholdengo's ability to block status moves and check Pokemon it struggles against such as Zamazenta and Iron Valiant and can capitalize on Gholdengo luring and weakening its other checks such as Great Tusk. Iron Valiant similarly benefits from Gholdengo's ability to check Hatterene, and it can lure and weaken key checks to Gholdengo such as Clodsire with Psyshock. Gholdengo often struggles against offensive teams due to its poor matchup against many key threats such as Darkrai, Kingambit, Iron Moth, and Roaring Moon. Great Tusk and Dondozo can help alleviate pressure by dealing with Kingambit while simultaneously benefiting from Gholdengo's defensive profile against faster special attackers such as Enamorus. Ting-Lu and Clodsire can handle the special attackers that give Gholdengo trouble, such as Dragapult, and accentuate Gholdengo's threat level with entry hazards. While Gholdengo is excellent at keeping entry hazards on the field, it can often struggle against opposing entry hazard setters such as Ting-Lu, Hisuian Samurott, and Clodsire, particularly if it is unable to Terastallize. Therefore, hazard removal support from Great Tusk is beneficial.</p>"

      "Hex": {
        "description": "<p>Hex Gholdengo is a powerful support Pokemon and paralysis spreader. Thunder Wave cripples many Pokemon Gholdengo typically struggles with such as Hisuian Samurott, Darkrai, and Cinderace while also being useful against Pokemon Gholdengo is tasked with handling, such as Zamazenta and Iron Valiant. It can then follow up with a powerful Hex on subsequent switch-ins. Make It Rain is the preferred option in the last slot to hit specially frail Ground-types, such as Great Tusk and Landorus-T, and Garganacl for high damage. Dazzling Gleam still hits Great Tusk for good damage while also hitting other Pokemon such as Hisuian Samurott and Roaring Moon quite hard. Focus Blast is another option that can be used in the last slot, as it is Gholdengo's strongest move against Kingambit and Hisuian Samurott, having a good chance to OHKO both. However, its poor accuracy makes it quite unreliable compared to Dazzling Gleam or Make It Rain. 60 Speed EVs allow Gholdengo to outspeed Jolly Kingambit and uninvested Landorus-T. Gholdengo's item slot is quite flexible. Air Balloon allows Gholdengo to avoid Ground-type moves, letting it more reliably spinblock Great Tusk, as well as check Dragonite. Leftovers is also an option, as Gholdengo can force a good amount of switches, granting it more residual healing. Rocky Helmet greatly improves Gholdengo's matchup against Zamazenta, which is forced to use Crunch to meaningfully damage Gholdengo and as such takes significant chip damage. Colbur Berry can also be considered, as it allows Gholdengo to more effectively lure in and paralyze Dark-types such as Weavile and Darkrai while also making it a more reliable answer to Swords Dance Iron Valiant. On teams without hazard removal, Heavy Duty-Boots is also an option to avoid entry hazard damage. Gholdengo can be an effective Tera candidate in order to check a wider range of threats with Thunder Wave. Tera Fairy allows Gholdengo to better check utility Dragapult and resist Dark-type moves from Pokemon such as Roaring Moon, Weavile, and Darkrai, allowing it to get off a crucial Thunder Wave against them. Tera Fairy also has the added benefit of boosting Dazzling Gleam's damage, allowing it to OHKO Hisuian Samurott and Great Tusk while also being helpful against Garganacl by lowering Salt Cure damage. Alternatively, Tera Water improves Gholdengo's matchup against Fire-types such as Iron Moth and Cinderace.</p> <p>Gholdengo is an effective option on teams looking for a bulky spinblocker and paralysis support. Hazard setters such as Landorus-T, Ting-Lu, Glimmora, and Ribombee all benefit from its ability to block removal from the likes of Corviknight and Great Tusk. Kingambit greatly benefits from Gholdengo's presence due to it checking Zamazenta and spreading paralysis, allowing Kingambit to outspeed and KO targets such as Darkrai, Weavile, and opposing Kingambit. Darkrai similarly appreciates Gholdengo's ability to paralyze Zamazenta, Iron Valiant, and Iron Moth, allowing it to more effectively sweep in the late-game. Iron Valiant also enjoys Gholdengo's presence to handle Galarian Slowking and Zamazenta, as well as its ability to spread paralysis to make Iron Valiant less reliant on Booster Energy to revenge kill Pokemon such as Darkrai. Garganacl appreciates Gholdengo's ability to spinblock its Stealth Rock and handle Pokemon it struggles against, such as Galarian Slowking and Encore users such as Ogerpon and Iron Valiant. In turn, Garganacl aids Gholdengo against Fire-types it may struggle against such as Iron Moth, as well as opposing Ghost-types such as Dragapult. As this Gholdengo set is not running a boosting move, it can struggle to make progress against certain Pokemon, particularly bulky Ground- and Electric-types such as Ting-Lu, Iron Treads, and Raging Bolt. As such, it appreciates partners that can handle these types of Pokemon. Great Tusk is an excellent partner, as it can undo any hazards Ting-Lu or Iron Treads set up, switch into Raging Bolt's Electric-type moves, and deal good damage to all three with Headlong Rush. It is also effective against other Pokemon Gholdengo may struggle with such as Kingambit. Darkrai can lure and deal heavy damage to Ground-types such as Ting-Lu and Clodsire with its Nasty Plot-boosted Ice Beam, making it easier for Gholdengo to break through them later. Ogerpon-W can easily break past Ground-types with Ivy Cudgel and is effective at luring in and KOing Raging Bolt with Play Rough. It also appreciates Gholdengo's ability to handle Zamazenta and paralyze faster targets such as Darkrai and Roaring Moon. As Gholdengo's bulk is middling, it can be prone to being overwhelmed by faster threats such as Darkrai, Roaring Moon, and Iron Moth. Dragonite and Raging Bolt can revenge kill these Pokemon with their powerful Extreme Speed and Thunderclap, respectively, while also being able to weaken Ground-types that may switch into Gholdengo with Ice Spinner and Draco Meteor, respectively. Similarly, Zamazenta can also use these Pokemon as an entry point to set up and sweep with Iron Defense. Dragonite and Zamazenta appreciate Gholdengo's ability to handle their checks such as Enamorus and Skarmory, while Raging Bolt appreciates Gholdengo's ability to weaken Ground-type such as Ting-Lu and Great Tusk. As any status will boost Hex's power, Gholdengo appreciates support from other status spreaders. Moltres can help by spreading burns with Flame Body on Pokemon that typically annoy Gholdengo such Great Tusk and Kingambit while also checking Fire-types like Cinderace. Gliscor is similarly effective at spreading Toxic against Ground- and Electric-types such as Ting-Lu and Raging Bolt, while also completely walling Clodsire. In turn, Gholdengo helps Gliscor maintain its Spikes on the field.</p>"

      "Choice Scarf": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Scarf Gholdengo is a great speed control option in the tier capable of outrunning and revenge killing premier offensive threats like Dragapult, Choice Specs Enamorus, and Weavile. Shadow Ball allows it to threaten foes like Galarian Slowking, Skarmory, and Dragapult, while Make It Rain, with its high Base Power, not only becomes challenging to switch into but also enables Gholdengo to effectively revenge kill Pokemon like Enamorus. Trick is a good utility move that allows it to Choice-lock Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Gliscor, hampering their effectiveness. Focus Blast enables Gholdengo to hit Dark-types like Kingambit, Hisuian Samurott, and Ting-Lu. Alternatively, Nasty Plot can be used to turn Gholdengo into a potent late-game cleaner once it has successfully used Trick to get rid of its Choice Scarf. In another vein, Recover can be utilized to keep Gholdengo healthy, especially against bulkier foes, once it has used Trick, allowing it to check them more consistently. Tera Fighting gives Gholdengo a resistance to Dark-type moves, most notably Sucker Punch from Kingambit, and it gives Focus Blast a STAB boost. Alternatively, Tera Flying can be used to help Gholdengo against Ground-types like Great Tusk and Gliscor.</p> <p>Gholdengo fits well on bulky offense and balance teams, where it functions as a great revenge killer. Teammates that benefit from Gholdengo's presence include Pokemon that appreciate its ability to handle fast and strong offensive threats. For instance, setup sweepers like Calm Mind Raging Bolt and Bulk Up Great Tusk can capitalize on Gholdengo's ability to revenge kill and weaken opposing threats like Dragapult and Choice Specs Enamorus, creating opportunities for Gholdengo's partners to set up and sweep. Great Tusk's access to Rapid Spin also synergizes well with Gholdengo, which is punished by Spikes, so getting rid of them gives Gholdengo more opportunities to switch in. Entry hazard setters like Gliscor, Skarmory, and Ting-Lu also benefit from Gholdengo's ability to serve as an emergency spinblocker. Due to its vulnerability to Dark-type Pokemon like Kingambit and Hisuian Samurott, exacerbated by its reliance on the inaccurate Focus Blast and the inherent risk of being Choice-locked, Gholdengo greatly benefits from the support of teammates that check the aforementioned foes, such as Zamazenta and Iron Valiant. Rillaboom also deserves a special mention as a teammate, as its Grassy Terrain weakens the super effective Earthquake, in addition to acting as a check to foes like Ting-Lu. In return, Gholdengo helps Rillaboom by handling threats that would otherwise be problematic for the latter, such as Corviknight and Skarmory.</p>"

      "Defensive Hazard Setter": {
        "description": "<p>With incredible bulk, Vessel of Ruin, and access to both Spikes and Stealth Rock, Ting-Lu is one of OU's premier hazard setters and also doubles as a special wall. Spikes are used to hit grounded Stealth Rock-resistant Pokemon like Kingambit and Gholdengo harder, while Stealth Rock can be used instead to damage Spikes-immune Pokemon like Corviknight that repeatedly switch into Ting-Lu, as well as punish Stealth Rock-weak Pokemon like Iron Moth and Enamorus. Thanks to its huge bulk, Ting-Lu is able to take super effective hits from setup sweepers like Calm Mind Iron Valiant and Iron Boulder and phaze them with Whirlwind in return; in addition to this, Whirlwind forces in opposing Pokemon, which will take damage from Ting-Lu's hazards unless they hold Heavy-Duty Boots. Ruination deals meaningful damage to switch-ins like Rillaboom, Great Tusk, and Hatterene while forcing walls like Alomomola, Garganacl, and Clefable to waste their recovery moves. Leftovers provides consistent recovery, while Heavy-Duty Boots prevents Ting-Lu from getting overwhelmed by entry hazards, mainly Spikes from opposing hazard-stacking teams. Alternatively, Red Card allows Ting-Lu to take a hit from a threatening foe—specifically a setup sweeper—and force it out, taking advantage of its huge overall bulk to even take on physical attackers and super effective special attacks, such as from Roaring Moon and Hatterene. Tera Poison is used to help Ting-Lu better check Fairy- and Fighting-types like Enamorus, Zamazenta, and especially Iron Valiant and grant it an immunity to Toxic, while Tera Ghost can be run instead to nullify Ting-Lu's Fighting-type weakness and allow it to spinblock Great Tusk and Iron Treads, though this comes at the cost of being weak to Ghost-types like Gholdengo and Choice Specs Dragapult as well as Dark-types like Darkrai, Kingambit, and Roaring Moon that Ting-Lu would otherwise check.</p> <p>Ting-Lu fits well as a support option on nearly any balance team. Offensive partners like Dragapult and Zamazenta appreciate entry hazard support to make foes easier to KO, while physically defensive partners like Dondozo and Skarmory benefit from Ting-Lu's ability to handle special attackers like Gholdengo and Raging Bolt. Skarmory is particularly notable for forming a strong defensive hazard-stacking core with Ting-Lu, being able to switch into Pokemon like Meowscarada and Weavile that threaten it. Aside from being potent late-game cleaners that appreciate Ting-Lu spreading chip damage early-game, offensive partners like Weavile and Meowscarada pair well, since they're able to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from opposing Pokemon with Knock Off to make Ting-Lu's hazard stacking more effective as well as pressure Gliscor, which Ting-Lu struggles significantly against. Galarian Slowking and Gholdengo are both great defensive partners for Ting-Lu to handle Fairy-types like Hatterene and Iron Valiant, with the former able to provide additional pressure with Future Sight and the latter also able to block hazard removal.</p>"

  "Roaring Moon": {
    "sets": {
      "Dragon Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Dragon Dance Roaring Moon is one of the tier's most dangerous sweepers due to its fantastic Attack and Speed complemented further by its decent bulk, a great typing both offensively and defensively, and diverse coverage options that dramatically limit its defensive counterplay. Acrobatics, thanks to its perfect synergy with Booster Energy, boasts excellent coverage alongside Knock Off by giving Roaring Moon an incredibly powerful option to super effectively hit threats like Great Tusk as well as Ogerpon-W, Serperior, and Rillaboom without the need to Dragon Dance; between it and Knock Off, Roaring Moon hits much of the tier for at least neutral damage, which is often enough for it to clean up late-game. Earthquake OHKOes threats that can survive a boosted Knock Off or Acrobatics, such as offensive Kingambit, Raging Bolt, and Iron Treads. Taunt drastically improves Roaring Moon's matchup against defensive teams by preventing threats like Dondozo, Ting-Lu, Tera Fairy Skeledirge, and Skarmory from disrupting its sweep with their recovery, status, or setup moves; Taunt is still useful against more offensive teams by virtue of preventing Serperior from stopping Roaring Moon's sweep with Glare, denying Glimmora multiple layers of entry hazards, or preventing defensive Pokemon like Gliscor and Terastallized Garganacl from wearing it down. Similar to Taunt, Substitute is an option to prevent Roaring Moon from being crippled by Clefable's Thunder Wave and Gliscor's Toxic, but additionally blocks Almomomola's Scald and Gargnacl's Salt Cure as well as preventing it from being revenge killed easily if it manages to keep it up. Subsitute also gives Roaring Moon protection against revenge killing attempts, especially Kingambit's Sucker Punch post-Terastallization. Brick Break is an interesting alternative; it outright OHKOes Weavile and defensive Kingambit, hits Darkrai and opposing Roaring Moon super effectively, and greatly improves Roaring Moon's matchup against opposing dual screens or Aurora Veil teams. Tera Flying grants Roaring Moon some noteworthy defensive benefits, including turning its Fighting weakness into a resistance and granting it a Ground immunity, but its greatest benefit is giving Roaring Moon access to the absurd power of STAB Acrobatics; with the boost from Tera Flying, Roaring Moon can OHKO max HP Great Tusk without even needing a boost from Dragon Dance while having a chance to OHKO Zamazenta after a Dragon Dance. Tera Ground can be used to boost Earthquake, letting it overwhelm Pokemon like Sticky Barb Clefable, bulky Kingambit, and Tera Steel Great Tusk more easily. A Jolly nature is preferred to outpace Booster Energy Iron Valiant after a Dragon Dance, but the power increase from an Adamant nature is enough to OHKO bulky Kingambit with Earthquake without any chip damage while securing more reliable KOs against Zamazenta and bulkier Great Tusk variants. An alternative spread of 32 HP / 220 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe with a Jolly nature is a niche option that allows Roaring Moon to obtain a Speed boost from Protosynthesis; though this comes at a considerable loss of power, it allows Roaring Moon to immediately outspeed threats like Booster Energy Iron Valiant, which Roaring Moon can struggle to set up against, while giving it the ability to revenge kill weakened Speed-boosting Protosynthesis users like Great Tusk and Walking Wake without needing to set up a Dragon Dance.</p> <p>Roaring Moon is a staple on fast-paced hyper offense teams that can help facilitate its sweep, though on these teams it can also serve as a wallbreaker to help facilitate other setup sweepers as needed. Hisuian Samurott and Glimmora can reliably set up entry hazards to help Roaring Moon reliably OHKO bulky Kingambit without needing to commit to an Adamant nature, while dual screens setters like Deoxys-S, Alolan Ninetales, and Grimmsnarl can allow Roaring Moon to set up more safely, grant it a safety net against strong priority from the likes of Weavile and Tera Normal Dragonite, or even allow Roaring Moon to set up multiple Dragon Dances and devastate opposing offensive teams. Deoxys-S is a particularly excellent teammate for Roaring Moon; it can act as a fast dual screens setter, an entry hazard setter that can deny opposing hazards while bypassing Hatterene's Magic Bounce with Skill Swap, or a standalone offensive threat that can help overwhelm threats like Dondozo, Skarmory, and Tera Fairy Skeledirge with its excellent coverage while allowing Roaring Moon to maximize its own coverage instead of running Taunt. Fast Booster Energy users like Iron Valiant and Iron Boulder synergize well with Roaring Moon; Roaring Moon can serve as more of a wallbreaker alongside these threats, using its high immediate damage output and Knock Off to wear down or eliminate threats like Gholdengo, Clodsire, Dondozo, and Corviknight to enable their late-game sweeps. Dragonite can help overwhelm physical walls that Roaring Moon may struggle with while utilizing their alternate defensive profiles to cover Roaring Moon's shortcomings. Dragonite's Extreme Speed acts as a strong priority attack to deal with opposing priority users like Weavile and Raging Bolt, which can revenge kill Roaring Moon with Ice Shard and Thunderclap, respectively. Kingambit greatly appreciates Roaring Moon's ability to pressure Fire-types like Cinderace and Heatran, and in return its great bulk and typing can allow it to handle threats like Weavile and Meowscarada lacking Low Kick. Lastly, Roaring Moon can fit reasonably well on Psychic Terrain teams spearheaded by Indeedee; Psychic Terrain keeps Roaring Moon safe from opposing priority attacks until it activates Tera Flying, and such a playstyle helps facilitate offensive threats that Roaring Moon already synergizes well with such as Iron Boulder and Expanding Force Deoxys-S.</p>"

      "Choice Band": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Band Roaring Moon is an elite physical wallbreaker on sun teams thanks to its phenomenal Attack and great Speed stats, either of which can be further boosted by its Protosynthesis. Knock Off is extremely spammable and difficult to safely switch into, giving Roaring Moon a strong STAB move that can even support the rest of its team with item removal. Outrage is a brutally strong STAB move that is impossible to switch into without a Fairy-type, easily allowing Roaring Moon to break past physical walls like Gliscor and Dondozo. Iron Head is used to hit Fairy-types such as Clefable and Enamorus for super effective damage; however Earthquake is an alternative to Iron Head that allows Roaring Moon to hit Steel-types, particularly Kingambit lacking Air Balloon, for super effective damage. U-turn is pivotal for maintaining momentum, allowing it to safely bring in threats such as Walking Wake onto the field. 220 Attack EVs and maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature are necessary for Roaring Moon to attain a boost to its Speed via Protosynthesis, allowing it to always outspeed Dragapult, Iron Valiant, and Choice Scarf Enamorus. Alternatively, simply running maximum Attack and Speed EVs gives Roaring Moon an Attack boost through its Protosynthesis, letting it 2HKO Skarmory with Knock Off and Dondozo with Outrage, alongside always netting an OHKO on Kingambit with Earthquake. Tera Dark is the premier Tera type for this set, as it powers up Knock Off to unprecedented levels of power, inflicting heavy damage on Gliscor, Skarmory, and even Clefable, whereas Tera Steel can be used to gain STAB on Iron Head and to withstand Dragon- and Fairy-type attacks.</p> <p>This set functions best on sun teams, leveraging Torkoal to set the sun for Roaring Moon to take advantage of, with the former also checking Bug-, Ice-, and Fairy-types for the latter. Roaring Moon is vulnerable to repeated chip damage from entry hazards, which can wear it down very quickly if left unchecked. Hatterene and Great Tusk are much appreciated forms of hazard control that can also check some of the threats Roaring Moon struggles against, with Hatterene forcing out Dragon- and Fighting-types, namely Dragonite, Iron Valiant, and Zamazenta, and Great Tusk being able to force out Kingambit while generally acting as a reliable physical tank. Venusaur and Kingambit also pair very well with Roaring Moon on sun, with Venusaur forcing Primarina and Great Tusk out alongside Kingambit's reliability in taking on Meowscarada and Swords Dance Weavile. In return, Roaring Moon is able to soften up the opposing team for Venusaur and Kingambit to clean up in the late-game. Walking Wake and Raging Bolt can form an incredibly potent wallbreaking core with Roaring Moon, as both appreciate its Knock Off crippling their checks, and Raging Bolt can form a potent pivoting core with Roaring Moon that can easily take advantage of forced switch-ins.</p>"

  "Iron Valiant": {
    "sets": {
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Iron Valiant is a premier wallbreaker and setup sweeper that uses Calm Mind to boost its attacks to OHKO foes such as Kyurem and Deoxys-S. Shadow Ball is a powerful coverage option, allowing Iron Valiant to damage Pokemon such as Gholdengo, Skeledirge, and Galarian Slowking that would otherwise be difficult to break through. Psyshock is a way for Iron Valiant to damage special walls like Blissey and Clodsire that it's unable to break through otherwise, as well as a solid option against Volcarona. Encore is able to stop opposing sweepers from setting up, locking them into setup moves, thus forcing them to switch out. Encore also breaks through walls by locking them out of their recovery moves, such as by trapping Clodsire into Stealth Rock and denying its access to Recover. In addition, Encore gives Iron Valiant an opportunity to set up additional boosts with Calm Mind and stops late-game Kingambit by locking it into Sucker Punch after it's knocked out a teammate. Vacuum Wave is an alternative option that lets Iron Valiant OHKO Kingambit after a Calm Mind as well as gives it priority to finish off weakened faster foes such as Choice Scarf Meowscarada, Choice Scarf Darkrai, and Dragon Dance-boosted Roaring Moon. Tera Ghost boosts the damage of Shadow Ball, allowing a 2HKO on Galarian Slowking and Skeledirge as well as getting an OHKO on Gholdengo after a Calm Mind. Tera Steel, on the other hand, is a purely defensive option, giving Iron Valiant sudden resistances to every type it was previously weak to, making threatening attacks like Sludge Bomb from Galarian Slowking and Darkrai non-issues. This also allows it the opportunity to survive a hit it otherwise wouldn't, such as Kingambit's Iron Head and Gholdengo's Make It Rain, and revenge kill afterwards or secure another boost from Calm Mind. Tera Fairy not only boosts Moonblast's damage, which guarantees a knockout on Kyurem and Zamazenta, but also removes Iron Valiant's weakness to opposing Fairy-type attacks from Enamorus and opposing Iron Valiant.</p> <p>Iron Valiant is able to support offensive teams with its incredible Speed and ability to set up and sweep. It synergizes well with other sweepers on offensive teams, forming solid cores that can cover each other's weaknesses. Some of these sweepers include Roaring Moon, Dragonite, and Gouging Fire, which can all boost and take out foes that Iron Valiant struggles with like Gholdengo, Galarian Slowking, and Heatran. In return, Iron Valiant can cover physically defensive Pokemon that these teammates would have trouble breaking through, such as Dondozo and Zamazenta. Iron Valiant is vulnerable to certain Pokemon that it isn't able to immediately deal with by boosting up and knocking them out. Gholdengo in particular is able to take all of Iron Valiant's hits even if it's running Shadow Ball and immediately knock it out with Make It Rain. Kingambit is an excellent partner that can take out Gholdengo as well as force out other threats to Iron Valiant such as Galarian Slowking; the synergy between Sucker Punch and Booster Energy allows them to secure revenge kills that the other cannot, such as Iron Valiant taking care of Walking Wake and Kingambit beating Iron Boulder. Iron Valiant can also form overload cores with similar Pokemon to wear down their shared checks; Ogerpon-W can help with this thanks to its access to Taunt and Encore, while other Calm Mind sweepers like Enamorus and Primarina can help wear down checks like Galarian Slowking and Gholdengo. Raging Bolt is also a solid teammate option that can take on Primarina and Enamorus thanks to Thunderclap; in return, Iron Valiant can take care of faster Dragon-types that threaten Raging Bolt. When used on bulkier team structures, Iron Valiant is very susceptible to being worn down by entry hazards over the course of a game; having a partner with Rapid Spin like Great Tusk can help relieve this pressure. Pokemon with pivoting moves such as Galarian Slowking and Landorus-T appreciate having a fast, powerful sweeper that they can get in safely, allowing Iron Valiant to switch in on Pokemon like Dragapult, Roaring Moon, and Kyurem without taking damage.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Swords Dance Iron Valiant establishes itself as a dangerous sweeper in the OU metagame due to its immense Attack stat along with its excellent coverage and Speed, bolstered further by Booster Energy. Due to Iron Valiant's diversity in sets, Swords Dance Iron Valiant creates openings for it to sweep or gain a great advantage against Pokemon that would normally check its more common specially offensive set, such as Galarian Slowking. Iron Valiant works best as a late-game sweeper, picking off opposing foes and punishing switches by setting up a Swords Dance, and Knock Off hits Ghost- and Psychic-types such as Gholdengo and Galarian Slowking for great damage and offers great utility. Encore gives Iron Valiant more opportunities to set up by locking a passive Pokemon into one move or threatening offensive setup Pokemon such as Kingambit and Volcarona by locking them into Sucker Punch or Quiver Dance, respectively. However, Iron Valiant may choose to use Spirit Break over Encore to ease the matchup against Dragon-types such as Dragonite, Raging Bolt, and Walking Wake as well as hitting Fairy-types such as Enamorus, Hatterene, and opposing Iron Valiant. Iron Valiant's use of Booster Energy allows it to outspeed most Pokemon, with the drawback of being single-use. Swords Dance Iron Valiant's choice of Terastallization is between Dark and Steel, with the former boosting Iron Valiant's Knock Off even harder, most notably guaranteeing an OHKO against Volcarona, one of its offensive checks, after a Swords Dance. Additionally, Tera Dark Iron Valiant can absorb a Future Sight in a pinch and still resist Kingambit's Sucker Punch to avoid being revenge killed. Similarly, Tera Steel Iron Valiant lets it easily set up on its common checks such as Galarian Slowking and Gholdengo, and it can take advantage of its new resistances against common revenge killers such as Make it Rain Gholdengo, opposing Iron Valiant, Extreme Speed Dragonite, Grassy Glide Rillaboom, and Acrobatics Roaring Moon.</p> <p>Iron Valiant's incredible Attack and Speed as well as its access to Swords Dance makes it a staple on hyper offense teams. Swords Dance Iron Valiant being a great lure against Pokemon such as Galarian Slowking and Gholdengo opens winning endgame paths for Pokemon walled by the two of them, such as Volcarona and Zamazenta. Iron Valiant is also an amazing Kingambit answer, which teammates such as Dragapult and Gholdengo appreciate. Swords Dance Iron Valiant struggles to deal with physical walls, such as Gliscor, Skarmory, Dondozo, and Landorus-T, which hinder its ability to sweep and get the most out of its value offensively. Teammates such as Ogerpon-W, Dragapult, Hatterene, and Volcarona deal with the aforementioned walls by outright threatening them or turning them into setup fodder. Entry hazards make Iron Valiant more prone to being revenge killed, making teammates that remove them such as Cinderace, Glimmora, and Great Tusk synergize with it very well on an offensive team. Iron Valiant also enjoys hazards from its own teammates, making its cleaning easier as well as having great synergy with Knock Off, which removes important items from Pokemon such as Heavy-Duty Boots Skeledirge, Rocky Helmet Skarmory, and Leftovers Zamazenta. Great entry hazard leads such as Hisuian Samurott, Glimmora, and Deoxys-S complement Iron Valiant well.</p>"
      },
      "Mixed": {
        "description": "<p>With its great coverage, high attacking stats, and amazing Speed backed up by Speed Booster Energy, Iron Valiant is one of the tier's best revenge killers. Iron Valiant's Moonblast hits most Pokemon in OU for at least neutral damage, while Close Combat complements it by dealing super effective damage against Kingambit, Heatran, Excadrill, and the occasional Blissey. Knock Off allows Iron Valiant to threaten Gholdengo, Galarian Slowking, and Skeledirge, which resist both of its STAB moves, and it provides utility for the rest of its team by removing items like Heavy-Duty Boots. Alternatively, Psyshock can be used to threaten Clodsire, Iron Moth, and Toxapex. Encore can be used to lock foes into setup moves such as Volcarona's Quiver Dance, Gouging Fire's Dragon Dance, and Zamazenta's Iron Defense, as well as recovery and status moves such as Skeledirge's Slack Off, Corviknight's Roost, and Gliscor's Protect; Encore is also effective at locking Raging Bolt into Thunderclap and Kingambit and Hisuian Samurott into Sucker Punch, granting one of Iron Valiant's teammates a free switch. Destiny Bond is another option that can lure unsuspecting foes, particularly setup sweepers that Iron Valiant can't reliably OHKO, such as Volcarona, Nasty Plot Gholdengo, and Calm Mind Hatterene looking to KO Iron Valiant only to also faint in the process. Destiny Bond is particularly effective because offensive Pokemon will often respect the possibility of Iron Valiant using Encore to lock them into an undesirable move and attack straight away instead, falling victims to Destiny Bond. Booster Energy grants Iron Valiant a one-time Speed boost needed for it to outspeed otherwise faster foes such as Weavile, Dragapult, Zamazenta, and unboosted Roaring Moon. Tera Steel turns all of Iron Valiant's weaknesses into resistances, such as Galarian Slowking's Sludge Bomb and Future Sight, Gholdengo's Make It Rain, Roaring Moon's Acrobatics, and Enamorus's and opposing Iron Valiant's Moonblast. Tera Steel also grants Iron Valiant resistances to Dragonite's Extreme Speed and Rillaboom's Grassy Glide, preventing them from revenge killing it. Tera Fairy can be used instead to power up Iron Valiant's Moonblast, allowing it to OHKO Kyurem and Raging Bolt, as well as Enamorus after one round of Stealth Rock. Tera Dark is another option that power ups Iron Valiant's Knock Off to further threaten Gholdengo, Galarian Slowking, and Skeledirge.</p> <p>Mixed Iron Valiant is best on offensive teams that appreciate its ability to revenge kill foes and whose fast-paced nature allows Iron Valiant to make the most out of Booster Energy. Iron Valiant's great coverage also allows it to act as a potent wallbreaker against slower-paced teams that it naturally outspeeds. Kingambit, Roaring Moon, and offensive Great Tusk enjoy Iron Valiant's ability to threaten opposing Great Tusk, Dondozo, and Zamazenta on their weaker Special Defense, while in return, they can threaten Gholdengo, Galarian Slowking and Skeledirge, which can stop Iron Valiant. Dragapult is another Pokemon able to threaten the aforementioned foes, and it appreciates Iron Valiant handling Ting-Lu, Garganacl, and Kingambit, which can be troublesome for Dragapult. Raging Bolt benefits from Iron Valiant's good matchup into Ground-types such as Great Tusk, Ting-Lu, Iron Treads, and Excadrill, as well as faster Dragon-types in Dragapult, Kyurem, and Walking Wake. Raging Bolt can in turn threaten Torkoal, Primarina, and Brave Bird Corviknight, which can win the one-on-one against Iron Valiant. Entry hazard support from Pokemon like Glimmora, Landorus-T, Hisuian Samurott, and Deoxys-S provides Iron Valiant with the extra chip it needs to get past foes. In turn, Iron Valiant's Knock Off can remove Heavy-Duty Boots from foes, particularly Volcarona and Skeledirge, making them susceptible to said hazards and opening the path for teammates like Rillaboom to sweep late-game.</p>"

  "Walking Wake": {
    "sets": {
      "Sun Wallbreaker": {
        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Walking Wake is a powerful wallbreaker and a staple on sun teams due to its unique offensive typing, amazing Special Attack, high Speed, and signature Hydro Steam, which is a powerful Water-type STAB move that takes full advantage of the sun. Draco Meteor is a brutally powerful STAB move that synergizes wonderfully with Hydro Steam, capable of OHKOing Water-resistant Pokemon including the likes of Ogerpon-W and Raging Bolt, in addition to 2HKOing nearly every Pokemon in the metagame barring Fairy-types such as Clefable and Primarina. Flamethrower guarantees an OHKO on Corviknight and bulky variants of Kingambit, though Flamethrower isn't used very often in practice due to Walking Wake's already fantastic STAB combination; Weather Ball is a stronger alternative to Flamethrower and allows Walking Wake to still take advantage of opposing weathers such as rain or snow. Dragon Pulse can be used in the last slot, which forgoes Draco Meteor's raw power for more consistency; however, Flip Turn allows Walking Wake to generate momentum for its team, taking advantage of switch-ins from the likes of Galarian Slowking and Primarina to safely bring in its teammates; lastly, Knock Off allows it to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from checks such as Galarian Slowking. 244 Special Attack EVs gives Walking Wake a Speed boost from Protosynthesis, making it a potent late-game cleaner against offensive teams due to its power coupled with its heightened Speed, letting it outspeed and threaten would-be revenge killers like Dragapult and Choice Scarf Enamorus; alternatively, Walking Wake can sacrifice the Speed boost for even more power by fully investing in Special Attack, allowing it to break through the likes of Primarina through sheer strength. Tera Water boosts its Hydro Steam's power even further, bolstering its cleaning potential against offense while 2HKOing even resistant Pokemon such as Toxapex after Stealth Rock, and allows Walking Wake to 2HKO even Blissey should it opt for a Special Attack boost; however, Tera Fairy could be considered as an alternative, granting it an immunity to Draco Meteor from Dragapult and opposing Walking Wake as well as a resistance to Kingambit's Sucker Punch. Mystic Water is a viable alternative, allowing Walking Wake to switch up moves while still boosting its most spammable attack in Hydro Steam.</p> <p>Walking Wake is a mainstay on sun teams, requiring Torkoal to set the sun with Drought. Torkoal can also set Stealth Rock, which makes defensively answering Walking Wake even more difficult, as checks such as Primarina would repeatedly have to sustain chip damage. Hatterene and Great Tusk are also great teammates for Walking Wake, alleviating the issue of entry hazards limiting its longevity; Hatterene is also capable of forcing out checks such as Toxapex and Iron Valiant, while Great Tusk can check priority revenge killers such as Dragonite and Kingambit. In return, Walking Wake can consistently KO or force out either Pokemon's checks, notably taking on Skarmory for Great Tusk and Heatran for Hatterene. Choice Band Roaring Moon can pair with Walking Wake to form a devastating wallbreaking core, which can rapidly overwhelm each of their respective checks through raw power, such as Skarmory, Dondozo, Primarina, and Galarian Slowking. Walking Wake also appreciates Roaring Moon's powerful STAB Knock Off removing Heavy-Duty Boots from the likes of Toxapex, and can pivot on its switch-ins with Flip Turn to bring Roaring Moon onto the field. Hisuian Lilligant and Venusaur can threaten Water-types such as Primarina and Ogerpon-W; both also appreciate Walking Wake blowing holes into the opposing team's defenses, giving them ample opportunity to run off with the game after their checks have been weakened. Lastly, Raging Bolt greatly enjoys Walking Wake's efficiency in dismantling its checks, notably Unaware Clodsire, as doing so enables Raging Bolt to sweep more efficiently in mid- or late-game scenarios.</p>"

Strength Sap functions as recovery while preventing notable 2HKOs from threats like Hisuian Samurott, Rillaboom, and Meowscarada. Foul Play is ran to punish physical setup sweepers like Ogerpon-W and Dragonite, using their own attacking power against them. Stun Spore can be ran instead to paralyze faster threats like Iron Valiant and Cinderace, making it easier for its offensive teammates to revenge kill them, and synergizes well with Hex by letting it net 2HKOs against bulkier Pokemon that would otherwise have no problem staying in on it like Galarian Slowking and Moltres. Heavy-Duty Boots is ran to avoid the repeated entry hazard damage it may sustain from switching in constantly, but Rocky Helmet is worth a mention because it lets Sinistcha punish U-turn from Pokemon like Cinderace, Landorus-T, and Rillaboom, as well as Knock Off attempts from the aforementioned Rillaboom, Great Tusk, and Iron Treads. 96 Speed EVs allow Sinistcha to outspeed Adamant Kingambit and Ursaluna. Tera Poison is a great defensive Tera type that lets Sinistcha check Pokemon like Iron Valiant, Iron Moth, and Gliscor and avoid Toxic.

Hazard setters like Ting-Lu, Gliscor, Hisuian Samurott, and Clodsire work well with it; they can set up hazards and Sinistcha prevents Great Tusk from removing them. Great Tusk itself is a good teammate, since it can keep hazards off for Sinistcha, which will inevitably get its Heavy-Duty Boots removed, since most of the Pokemon it checks carry Knock Off; Great Tusk also checks Kingambit for it. Sinistcha is able to support Great Tusk by checking Grass- and Water-type threats like Ogerpon-W, Rillaboom, and Primarina. Weavile is a great partner for Sinistcha as well, since it's able to threaten a lot of Sinistcha's checks like Galarian Slowking, Gliscor, Raging Bolt, and Clodsire, and in return, Sinistcha is able to threaten bulky Water-types it has trouble breaking through like Alomomola, Primarina, and Dondozo. Galarian Slowking works well with Sinistcha, since it's able to take care of Kyurem and can also spread status, making Sinistcha's Hex more dangerous, while Sinistcha checks the Ground-types that threaten it like Great Tusk and Landorus-T. Toxapex is worth a mention on more defensive teams as a check to dangerous special attackers like Iron Valiant and Iron Moth. On sand teams, Sinistcha holds a valuable role as a check to Zamazenta and Grass- and Water-types like Ogerpon-W, Dondozo, and Rillaboom for Tyranitar and Excadrill; these Pokemon often stop Excadrill from sweeping. Tyranitar is able to function as a check to strong special threats that can crack Sinistcha open such as Kyurem, Iron Moth, and Dragapult, and Excadrill threatens offensive threats that can batter through Sinistcha's strong physical bulk like Roaring Moon and Weavile. Corviknight works well with Sinistcha as extra insurance against Ground-types and as a way to check Roaring Moon without the need to burn Tera. Stall teams also appreciate Sinistcha's unique ability to check Ogerpon-W and Ursaluna, since other checks like Corviknight and Dondozo often get overwhelmed. Blissey and Clodsire are amazing teammates for Sinistcha on stall teams because of their unmatched ability to wall special attackers like Raging Bolt, Darkrai, and Dragapult. Alomomola can pass Wish to keep Sinistcha alive more reliably, and Sinistcha can handle Ogerpon-W, which Alomomola greatly appreciates.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Ogerpon's high Attack and Speed along with its access to Defiant make it a reliable pivot and potent wallbreaker that can punish common defensive structures. Knock Off gives Ogerpon a complementary coverage option to Ivy Cudgel and can dissuade switch-ins such as Gholdengo; it also allows Ogerpon to support its team by removing the opposing Pokemon's held item, notably crippling Rock-weak Pokemon like Dragonite and Kyurem that rely on Heavy-Duty Boots. U-turn is a fantastic option that can maintain momentum while safely bringing in one of Ogerpon's teammates, in addition to dealing heavy damage to Grass-resistant foes such as Rillaboom and Roaring Moon. Encore can be used to shut down defensive walls like Terastallized Alomomola and Dondozo, as well as slow setup sweepers like Kingambit and Raging Bolt. Tera Grass gives Ogerpon a massive boost in power to its Ivy Cudgel, giving it enough firepower to 2HKO Hatterene and Landorus-T without a Defiant boost, and the +1 Speed boost from Embody Aspect allows it to outrun and threaten would-be faster Pokemon such as Meowscarada and Zamazenta, letting it reliably and safely use Encore on Iron Defense variants of the latter.</p> <p>Ogerpon should feel right at home on bulkier teams in need of a fast pivot. It struggles to make progress against Fire-types such as Gouging Fire and Heatran, often requiring them to be weakened or removed in order to start threatening teams. Thus, Garganacl and Gliscor make great teammates, as they manage to consistently switch into and threaten these Pokemon, set entry hazards for Ogerpon to take advantage of, and easily spread chip damage to wear down the opposing team. Ogerpon's ability to threaten Water-types like Primarina and Ogerpon-W is also greatly appreciated by both Pokemon. Alomomola is another valuable teammate thanks to its high bulk, low Speed, and access to Flip Turn allowing it to safely and consistently bring Ogerpon onto the field, as well as being able check the likes of Gouging Fire and Zamazenta. Additionally, Ogerpon with another fast wallbreaker can make for an efficient and potent wallbreaking core; therefore, Pokemon such as Weavile and Deoxys-S that help overwhelm Ogerpon's checks like Corviknight and Moltres make excellent teammates. It also enjoys having these Pokemon as naturally faster teammates as opposed to relying on Terastallization for speed control, and it likewise appreciates them for being able to threaten bulkier Dragon-types like Dragonite and Raging Bolt. Lastly, special tanks such as Galarian Slowking and Ting-Lu can safely switch in on powerful special wallbreakers like Dragapult and Iron Moth, and they also appreciate Ogerpon's reliability in punishing switch-ins like Landorus-T.</p>"

      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>With its Wellspring Mask-boosted power and good Speed tier alongside Swords Dance, Ogerpon-W is one of the most potent wallbreakers in the metagame. Generally, Power Whip is the better option, but at the cost of considerable power, it can opt for the more-accurate Horn Leech, which aids in recovering the chip damage it often takes from entry hazards throughout a game. However, it notably misses out on OHKOing Pelipper at +2 and Tera Water users like Galarian Slowking, Calm Mind Hatterene, and specially defensive Gliscor. Play Rough augments Ogerpon-W's coverage by allowing it to hit targets such as Roaring Moon, Dragapult, and Dragonite. Alternatively, Encore generates setup opportunities by locking foes into undesirable moves, such as Roost and Iron Defense from Corviknight or Skarmory, Sucker Punch from Kingambit, and Thunderclap from Raging Bolt. Knock Off can be used instead, which has the utility of removing items such as Dragonite's Heavy-Duty Boots and Skarmory's Rocky Helmet all while still hitting Dragapult, and it notably lands an OHKO after a Swords Dance versus defensive Gholdengo. Trailblaze is also an option; the boost to Ogerpon-W's Speed improves its ability to sweep, preventing it from being revenge killed by the likes of Weavile, Meowscarada, and Dragapult. Water Absorb allows it to take advantage of foes like Barraskewda and Alomomola using Flip Turn, preventing them from generating momentum, while its Scald immunity lets it freely set up on Alomomola. Tera Water is forced and bolsters the strength of Ivy Cudgel to absurd levels; after a Swords Dance, this allows it to OHKO Kingambit as well as Skarmory and Corviknight after Stealth Rock. In conjunction with the Special Defense boost granted by Embody Aspect, Tera Water has useful defensive properties too, allowing Ogerpon-W to check the likes of Iron Moth, Calm Mind Iron Valiant, and Gholdengo in a pinch.</p> <p>Ogerpon-W's wallbreaking prowess makes it well-suited to hyper offense and bulky offense teams. Kingambit is a good partner, as Ogerpon-W's wallbreaking enables it late-game through weakening foes that deal with it, such as Skarmory and Iron Defense Zamazenta. Similarly, Ogerpon-W appreciates Kingambit's ability to check Dragapult. Ogerpon-W is susceptible to taking a lot of chip damage from hazards as the game goes on; consequently, this makes Great Tusk a good partner, as it can keep them off the field. Choice Scarf Enamorus is a good partner, as it provides Healing Wish support, giving Ogerpon-W a second chance at wearing down the opponent's team. Ogerpon-W appreciates hazard support, as that helps facilitate its wallbreaking; teammates such as Glimmora and Deoxys-S are useful. Ogerpon-W often struggles to find opportunities to come in; pivots such as Galarian Slowking and Landorus-T are helpful. Galarian Slowking in particular also helps check Zapdos, which is one of the few Pokemon that Ogerpon-W can struggle against, while Landorus-T's ability to provide Stealth Rock is also appreciated. Iron Valiant, Calm Mind variants especially, is a good partner that appreciates Ogerpon-W's ability to pressure checks such as Skeledirge and Clodsire. In return, Iron Valiant is able to threaten Raging Bolt and faster threats that can revenge kill Ogerpon-W, such as Dragapult, Weavile, and Meowscarada.</p>"
      },
      "Offensive Pivot": {
        "description": "<p>Ogerpon-W is a fantastic pivot thanks to its combination of high Speed, power, and utility. It can outspeed and threaten out many key threats such as Great Tusk, Heatran, and Gliscor with its powerful Ivy Cudgel, which it can capitalize on to gain momentum with U-turn. Horn Leech complements Ivy Cudgel, hitting bulky Water-types such as Alomomola and Primarina for super effective damage and recovering HP, which is useful for mitigating entry hazard damage. U-turn allows Ogerpon-W to pivot out of bad matchups against Dragapult and Dragonite while also dealing high damage to Roaring Moon and many Grass-types that may want to switch into it, such as Rillaboom, Serperior, and Hydrapple. Taunt prevents Pokemon such as Clefable and Tera Grass Heatran from setting up entry hazards or using status as well as stopping recovery or setup attempts from Pokemon such as Skarmory, Dragonite, or Corviknight, which is useful in wearing them down over time. Alternatively, Encore can be used to punish setup from various Pokemon such as Kingambit, Zamazenta, and Garganacl while similarly disrupting walls such as Corviknight and Skarmory. Spikes can be run over Taunt or Encore, as Ogerpon-W can find many opportunities to lay Spikes due to the switches it forces and has good match-ups against various hazard removers such as Great Tusk and Iron Treads. Spikes synergizes well with U-turn, as their combined chip damage will wear down many of Ogerpon-W's switch-ins such as Tera Dragon Skarmory and Raging Bolt over time. Water Absorb allows Ogerpon-W to more safely switch into opposing Water-types such as Barraskewda, Hisuian Samurott, and Alomomola, notably making it riskier for these Pokemon to gain momentum with Flip Turn. Ogerpon-W is an average Terastallization candidate, as it is filling a supportive role and its Tera type is telegraphed. Nonetheless, the Special Defense boost Ogerpon-W gains when Terastallizing can be useful in a few scenarios, such as surviving Choice Specs Walking Wake's Draco Meteor and Gholdengo's Nasty Plot-boosted Shadow Ball after Stealth Rock. The lack of a Grass typing also allows it to match up more favorably against Pokemon such as Weavile, Iron Moth, and Heatran. The damage increase provided by Tera Water can also be useful, allowing Ogerpon-W to 2HKO Skarmory and Corviknight with Ivy Cudgel after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Ogerpon-W thrives on bulky offense teams. It synergizes well with other pivoting Pokemon. Landorus-T appreciates Ogerpon-W's ability to handle opposing Water-types such as Primarina while providing Ogerpon-W with Stealth Rock and Intimidate support. Landorus-T can also check Roaring Moon and Raging Bolt, which are difficult matchups for Ogerpon-W. Galarian Slowking benefits from Ogerpon-W's presence to deal with Ground-types such as Iron Treads and Gliscor as well as strong Water-types that can otherwise overwhelm it such as Walking Wake. In turn, Galarian Slowking can support Ogerpon-W via Future Sight and status spreading with Thunder Wave or Toxic, which are useful to wear down and cripple checks such as Dragonite and Raging Bolt. Galarian Slowking also checks key threats such as Serperior and Zapdos, which Ogerpon-W appreciates. Since Ogerpon-W is great at luring and breaking down the opponent's physical walls with Taunt or Encore, partners such as Kingambit, Weavile, and Roaring Moon can take advantage of the holes Ogerpon-W puts into walls such as Skarmory, Dondozo, and Gliscor to sweep more easily. Entry hazard support helps wear down many of Ogerpon-W's checks such as Raging Bolt and Serperior, so setters such as Great Tusk, Deoxys-S, and Ting-Lu are recommended teammates. As Ogerpon-W cannot hold Heavy-Duty Boots, it is quite vulnerable to entry hazard damage over time; hazard removal or prevention support from Great Tusk, Iron Treads, Hatterene, or Cinderace is thus appreciated. Ogerpon-W is good at luring several Pokemon such as Serperior, Rillaboom, Raging Bolt, and Dragonite, which it can safely pivot out of with U-turn; Dragapult can take advantage of Rillaboom, Raging Bolt, and Serperior, while Air Balloon Kingambit and Gholdengo do well against Dragonite. Additionally, Dragapult in particular can support Ogerpon-W further by spreading status.</p>"

        "description": "<p>Ogerpon-C's vast array of utility options, good STAB coverage, and great Speed tier make it a solid Spikes setter. Ogerpon-C's strong offensive STAB moves give it many opportunity to set up Spikes on forced switches. Additionally, it can apply pressure to hazard control Pokemon like Great Tusk, Hatterene, Corviknight, and Iron Treads, ensuring its reliability in getting entry hazards on the field. Power Whip is a stronger Grass-type STAB than Horn Leech, making a world of difference in threatening the likes of Great Tusk and Iron Treads that resist its powerful Ivy Cudgel. However, Horn Leech is a viable alternative thanks to its higher accuracy and healing properties, giving Ogerpon-C some much-appreciated longevity. It also synergizes well with Sturdy, allowing it to recover damage taken from entry hazards and bring it back to full HP. Knock Off is a great tool both offensively and utility-wise, providing coverage against the likes of Gholdengo and Iron Crown while removing Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Dragonite and Gouging Fire, making them vulnerable to chip damage from hazards. Ogerpon-C is forced to run Tera Rock, which powers up Ivy Cudgel, most importantly letting it snag a 2HKO on defensive Pokemon like Corviknight. Additionally, thanks to Embody Aspect, Ogerpon-C gets a Defense boost after Terastallization, which can improve its staying power against physical attackers like Dragonite.</p> <p>Spikes Ogerpon-C fits best on offensive teams as a strong Spikes setter able to overwhelm various common forms of entry hazard removal. Stealth Rock setters such as Landorus-T and Iron Treads appreciate Ogerpon-C's Spikes further acclimating chip damage on foes. Additionally, they appreciate its offensive capabilities against defensive Pokemon like Alomomola and Garganacl. Gholdengo is an amazing partner for Ogerpon-C thanks to its typing alongside Good as Gold shutting down attempts to remove hazards from the likes of Great Tusk, Corviknight, and Iron Treads. Ogerpon-C's efficiency against common physically defensive Pokemon like Great Tusk and Dondozo makes it a great partner for other physical attackers like Kingambit, Roaring Moon, and Gouging Fire. Iron Moth is another amazing offensive teammate thanks to its ability to obliterate Steel-types like Kingambit and Skarmory. Additionally, Iron Moth heavily appreciates Spikes more reliably securing KOs late-game. Rillaboom is another great offensive partner, helping overwhelm shared checks such as Zamazenta and Dragonite. Additionally, Ogerpon-C heavily appreciates Rillaboom's Grassy Terrain due to its residual healing alongside making Ogerpon-C's Grass-type STAB moves extremely powerful; under Grassy Terrain, Ogerpon-C's Power Whip can OHKO Great Tusk and Landorus-T after Stealth Rock. Ogerpon-C's typing leaves it very vulnerable to Kingambit; it cannot do very much damage to it while in return being 2HKOed by any move Kingambit chooses to use. Zamazenta is a great partner due to this, being a great Kingambit answer while also taking advantage of Spikes in its own right. Similarly, Iron Valiant can destroy Kingambit with Close Combat and heavily appreciates Ogerpon-C's Spikes helping facilitate a sweep.</p>"
      },
      "Swords Dance": {
        "description": "<p>Ogerpon-C can use Swords Dance to become one of the most terrifying wallbreakers in the tier, wielding near-unresisted coverage alongside high-power moves. Ogerpon-C finds ample opportunities to set up a boost, as its decent Speed tier, wide pool of potential coverage moves, and potentially helpful ability in Sturdy can often force switches. Ivy Cudgel is Ogerpon-C's main weapon, threatening even defensive Pokemon like Corviknight and Skarmory with its perfect accuracy, high power, and higher critical hit chance. For any Pokemon like Zamazenta or Garganacl that can handle Ivy Cudgel, Power Whip offers even higher power at the cost of a slight decrease in accuracy. With these two moves, a boosted Ogerpon-C threatens to OHKO or 2HKO almost everything in the tier, including common physical walls such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, Zamazenta, Alomomola, and Great Tusk. Power Whip also notably 2HKOes Unaware Dondozo, a common problem for other physical wallbreakers. Finally, Low Kick rounds out the set for valuable coverage on common foes like Kingambit and Tera Normal Dragonite among others. These moves cover a majority of the metagame, with the only common OU threat to resist its moveset being Gholdengo, which fears the optional but always useful Knock Off. Maximum Speed with a Jolly Nature is chosen to speed tie other Ogerpon and Iron Moth, as well as outspeeding Walking Wake, Ninetales-Alola, Iron Treads, and Enamorus. Ogerpon-C's Tera type is locked to Rock, which boosts Ivy Cudgel's power to ridiculous levels while also gaining a permanent +1 boost to Defense. For example, +2 Ivy Cudgel after Terastallization has a very high chance to OHKO maximum defense Skarmory and Corviknight after Stealth Rock damage, and it even gains a chance to OHKO defensive Gliscor from full health. While Ogerpon-C does lose access to Sturdy, Terastallization can still be a useful emergency button to boost Ogerpon-C's wallbreaking abilities or to avoid a timely revenge kill from moves such as Weavile or Meowscarada's Triple Axel.</p> <p>Ogerpon-C functions best on offensive teams, which appreciate its ability to break holes in many common defensive structures so that its teammates can clean up later in the game. Common physical cleaners such as Roaring Moon, Dragonite, and Kingambit appreciate their primary answers like Skarmory, Gliscor, and Dondozo being weakened and can help finish the job against Pokemon that can escape a one-on-one versus Ogerpon-C with their HP intact, like a defensive Gholdengo or Zamazenta. Ogerpon-C's main problem is its middling Speed tier versus other offensive threats, which can prevent setup opportunities. Opposing attackers such as Weavile and Darkrai threaten an outright OHKO, with Weavile even ignoring Sturdy, so Ogerpon-C appreciates teammates that can tank hits from these attackers such as Primarina and Zamazenta. Offensive utility Pokemon are also a problem, with foes such as Dragapult and Cinderace threatening to cripple Ogerpon-C with status moves like Will-O-Wisp or pivot out with U-turn for high damage. To handle this, Ogerpon-C appreciates teammates that can absorb or punish utility moves like Landorus-T, Corviknight, or Gliscor. Similarly, Gholdengo can OHKO Ogerpon-C with Make it Rain or cripple it with Thunder Wave while also being able to survive all of Ogerpon-C's main moves, so partners like Ting-Lu can be useful to switch in on and pressure Gholdengo. Finally, entry hazards pose an annoyance to Ogerpon-C, negating the benefits of Sturdy and causing unrecoverable damage, so hazard removal from teammates like Cinderace or Great Tusk can be helpful.</p>"

  "Raging Bolt": {
    "sets": {
      "Calm Mind": {
        "description": "<p>Calm Mind Raging Bolt is one of the metagame's top setup sweepers and wallbreakers. Its natural bulk and unique typing not only allows it to check common offensive threats like Ogerpon-W and Cinderace, but also to gain multiple entry points and setup opportunities as well. On top of a potent STAB combination that hits most of the metagame at least neutrally, its signature move Thunderclap prevents Raging Bolt's sweep from being cut short by faster threats and opposing priority users like Enamorus, Walking Wake, and Kingambit and lets it act as a revenge killer, too. Dragon Pulse is preferred for its consistent damage output, but Draco Meteor can be used to propel Raging Bolt's niche as a wallbreaker further, letting it overwhelm checks like Ting-Lu and Clodsire much more easily and netting benchmarks such as OHKOing defensive Landorus-T and Dragonite through Multiscale, all after a Calm Mind. A reliable Electric-type STAB move lets Raging Bolt prevent foes like Primarina, Gholdengo, and Calm Mind Enamorus from setting up freely and makes it less vulnerable to Encore users like Iron Valiant and Hisuian Samurott. Thunderbolt's consistency is preferred in this regard, but other options can be used as well. Discharge allows Raging Bolt to potentially cripple specially defensive walls like Galarian Slowking and slow down faster threats like Gholdengo, Darkrai, and Zamazenta, which helps to reduce its reliance on Thunderclap. Exclusively on rain teams, the stronger option in Thunder can also be used instead for similar reasons. Raging Bolt can lean towards the weather further by running Weather Ball instead if used on either a sun or rain team; it allows Raging Bolt to hit Iron Treads super effectively, with rain Weather Ball pressuring Raging Bolt's other Ground-type checks like Gliscor and Landorus-T more reliably, while sun Weather Ball cleanly OHKOes even bulky Kingambit and Gholdengo unboosted, all at the expense of the ability to immediately threaten Calm Mind Primarina. Alternatively, Taunt can be used to let Raging Bolt overwhelm walls like Blissey and Toxic Galarian Slowking. Booster Energy provides Raging Bolt with a damage boost, letting it reach feats such as OHKOing Iron Valiant with +1 Thunderclap after a layer of Spikes and specially defensive Gliscor with +1 Draco Meteor, as well as having significant rolls to 2HKO Clodsire with Draco Meteor. Leftovers gives it more longevity to set up more easily and further take advantage of its defensive profile. Air Balloon is another option to prevent revenge killing attempts from its Ground-type checks like Great Tusk, Landorus-T, and Ting-Lu. Tera Fairy gives Raging Bolt an immunity to Dragon-type attacks from foes like Dragapult and opposing Raging Bolt that don't fear its Thunderclap; it is also generally a good neutral typing against foes like Weavile and Iron Valiant. Tera Flying can be used for an outright immunity to Ground, letting it flip its matchup against Great Tusk and Landorus-T; this can be combined with Taunt to beat bulky Ground-type checks like Gliscor, Clodsire, and Ting-Lu. Tera Ghost is also an option with Taunt to beat Blissey one-on-one and give offensive teams an emergency check to IronPress Zamazenta. An EV spread of 64 HP / 28 Def / 252 SpA / 164 Spe is an alternative option; it runs enough Speed to get the jump on Gliscor, with the extra bulk letting Raging Bolt survive Speed Booster Energy Great Tusk's Headlong Rush from full, though this significantly worsens its matchup against opposing Raging Bolt.</p> <p>Raging Bolt fits on a variety of offensive teams, ranging from hyper offense to weather-based archetypes in sun and rain. It pairs well with other strong special attackers like Gholdengo, Iron Moth, and Darkrai; on top of keeping up the pressure against the opposition, they can work with Raging Bolt to wear down and overwhelm shared checks like Ting-Lu, Clodsire, Galarian Slowking, and Blissey. Physical setup sweepers like Kingambit, Ogerpon-W, Great Tusk, Dragonite, and Zamazenta are similarly important, as they can threaten out the aforementioned special walls and force damage against Landorus-T and opposing Great Tusk; some of these physical attackers can even switch into the Ground-types, and Raging Bolt uses their checks like Skarmory, Alomomola, and Dondozo as entry points and setup opportunities. Rillaboom also deserves a special mention; on top of providing Grassy Terrain to increase Raging Bolt's longevity and let it stomach Earthquake from foes like Landorus-T and Ting-Lu, Rillaboom can also bring Raging Bolt in safely via U-turn against switch-ins like Moltres, Corviknight, and Zapdos for setup opportunities. Entry hazard setters like Deoxys-S, Hisuian Samurott, Landorus-T, and Glimmora are highly appreciated, as hazards help put foes and especially its checks into KO range, with Landorus-T also capable of switching into Great Tusk, Iron Treads, and opposing Landorus-T that threaten Raging Bolt out; in return, Raging Bolt can take advantage of and pressure common hazard removal Pokemon like Corviknight and Cinderace to maintain said hazards. Raging Bolt can benefit from Drought users like Torkoal and Ninetales; the sun allows Raging Bolt to freely forgo Booster Energy and gives it the option to run Weather Ball. Raging Bolt also synergizes well with other sun wallbreakers; Walking Wake can exploit Ground-types like Ting-Lu, Iron Treads, and Gliscor while assisting Raging Bolt in pressuring Galarian Slowking and Blissey. This is especially strong because going for Tera Water to deal with Walking Wake makes them vulnerable to Raging Bolt. Roaring Moon and Great Tusk can complement Raging Bolt's breaking power by dealing with its special walls, and they overwhelm shared checks like Landorus-T and Great Tusk, with Raging Bolt handling the likes of Skarmory, Alomomola, and Tera Water Gliscor in return, especially since Roaring Moon can bring it safely via U-turn. Raging Bolt can also be used on rain teams, benefiting from Pelipper's Drizzle to run options like Weather Ball and Thunder. It forms a great core with Barraskewda, as Barraskewda can position Raging Bolt against its bulky Water-type checks like Alomomola and Tera Water Garganacl via Flip Turn; in return, Barraskewda alongside other rain wallbreakers like Overqwil can pressure and overwhelm Ground-types like Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Iron Treads for Raging Bolt. Defensively, Raging Bolt can check Rillaboom and Ogerpon-W, which are otherwise problematic for rain teams, while Pelipper is capable of switching into Ground-types like Landorus-T, Great Tusk, and Iron Treads that force Raging Bolt out. Though more niche, Raging Bolt can also fit on other hyper offense structures. Dual screens setters like Deoxys-S, Alolan Ninetales, and Grimmsnarl provide Raging Bolt with an easier time setting up against even super effective hits and prevent it from being revenge killed by foes like Weavile, Landorus-T, and Dragonite. Sticky Web from Ribombee can slow down would-be revenge killers like Great Tusk, minimizing the risk of Thunderclap mindgames against foes like Encore Iron Valiant and Substitute Iron Moth.</p>"

Zen Headbutt can be used to improve these matchups as well as provide a reliable means of revenge killing Booster Energy Iron Valiant, again in exchange for the Gholdengo matchup. Substitute is also a viable option, and it can be used to ease Iron Boulder's matchup versus Sucker Punch from Kingambit, as well as allowing it to avoid Thunder Wave from Galarian Slowking as it sets up. Given a free turn to set it up, Substitute can also allow Iron Boulder to avoid being revenge killed by priority, such as Rillaboom's Grassy Glide and Kingambit's Sucker Punch. However, its main use case is with Tera, as Substitute + Tera Flying allows Iron Boulder to circumvent Gliscor—which otherwise would be a solid check—and turn it into setup fodder by avoiding both Toxic and Earthquake. Running Taunt over Substitute is also an option; aside from beating Gliscor one-on-one with Tera Flying, it also allows Iron Boulder to overwhelm Skarmory by preventing its Iron Defense and Roost attempts. Tera Fighting boosts the power of Close Combat, notably helping Iron Boulder brute force its way past Skarmory, while also allowing it to OHKO Ting-Lu after a Swords Dance. It also provides a Sucker Punch resistance, which helps versus Kingambit. Tera Ground can be used to boost the power of Earthquake, guaranteeing the OHKO on bulkier variants of Gholdengo at +2 as well as helping Iron Boulder avoid being picked off by Raging Bolt's Thunderclap. Tera Flying not only lets Iron Boulder wall Gliscor in combination with Substitute but also grants it a resistance to Rillaboom's Grassy Glide and facilitates setup opportunities versus other Ground-types like Great Tusk and Landorus-T.</p> <p>Iron Boulder's power and its top-tier speed, alongside its good coverage and access to Swords Dance, make it very suitable for hyper offense teams. Teammates such as Kingambit appreciate the weakening of shared checks such as Landorus-T and Skarmory. The same goes for Iron Moth but with Ting-Lu and Gliscor. Iron Valiant also appreciates Gliscor being weakened and can whittle down shared checks such as Gholdengo to make it easier for Iron Boulder to sweep later. Iron Boulder struggles with entry hazard damage putting it in KO range of priority moves such as Kingambit’s Sucker Punch and Rillaboom’s Grassy Glide after Tera. Teammates that are effective at keeping hazards off your side such as Taunt Deoxys-S, Glimmora, Hatterene, or Great Tusk are good partners. The first two also provide their own hazards, facilitating the weakening of Iron Boulder's checks. Iron Boulder also has difficulty overcoming Dondozo. Partners that can weaken it or take advantage of it, such as Taunt Roaring Moon or Ogerpon-W, respectively, are good partners.</p>"

  "Iron Crown": {
    "sets": {
      "Assault Vest": {
        "description": "<p>Iron Crown serves as a strong offensive pivot and sturdy check to a bevy of special attackers like Calm Mind Iron Valiant and Enamorus courtesy of its well-rounded stats, good defensive profile, and solid offensive movepool alongside a great pivoting option in Volt Switch. Tachyon Cutter's multi-hit properties allow it to bypass Glimmora's Focus Sash to OHKO it before it can set up any entry hazards. Future Sight's delayed damage puts a tremendous amount of pressure on the opposing team, since Dark-types switching in to block Future Sight or Steel-types and special walls trying to sponge the attack will have to survive powerful physical attacks from teammates like Great Tusk, Kingambit, Hisuian Samurott, Zamazenta, and Weavile; Psychic Noise offers lower but more immediate damage while simultaneously nullifying recovery attempts from Gholdengo, Blissey, Corviknight, Garganacl, and Clodsire, allowing Iron Crown and its teammates to force significant damage against these threats. Focus Blast rounds out Iron Crown's coverage by hitting Kingambit, Ting-Lu, Roaring Moon, and Tera Steel Clodsire super effectively, and it is also its strongest attack against opposing Iron Crown. Volt Switch allows Iron Crown to capitalize on its ability to force out most special attackers and gain momentum for its team and has great synergy with Future Sight by safely pivoting in the aforementioned powerful physical attackers that can take advantage of the chip damage or switches it forces. Assault Vest greatly boosts Iron Crown's special bulk, allowing it to better handle special attackers like Calm Mind Iron Valiant and Enamorus. Choice Specs is a decent alternative for more offensive teams, boosting Iron Crown's damage output to staggering levels, letting it even outright 2HKO Blissey with Tera Fighting Focus Blast. However, this comes at the cost of greatly compromising its special bulk, being 2HKOed by Iron Valiant's Shadow Ball after Stealth Rock; it also prevents Iron Crown from switching moves. Tera Fighting turns Iron Crown's weakness to Dark-type attacks into a resistance, allowing it to survive Kingambit's Sucker Punch in a pinch and to play mindgames against Roaring Moon while letting it 2HKO Ting-Lu and physically defensive Corviknight with Focus Blast; Tera Fairy also offers a Dark resistance, but the Dragon immunity, Fighting resistance, and Fairy neutrality it provides allow Iron Crown to better check Dragapult and more reliably handle mixed and physical Iron Valiant sets without compromising its ability to check Calm Mind variants as heavily.</p> <p>Iron Crown is best run on bulky offense teams, which can both cover Iron Crown's defensive shortcomings and maintain a similar level of offensive pressure, often in the form of additional pivoting options to maintain momentum. Hisuian Samurott is a spectacular teammate; it can form a VoltTurn core with Iron Crown using Flip Turn, reliably set Spikes with Ceaseless Edge, and even remove Heavy-Duty Boots with its strong STAB Knock Off to allow the duo to rack up massive amounts of lasting damage through Spikes and Future Sight or Psychic Noise. The two share excellent defensive synergy, as Hisuian Samurott's Ghost and Dark resistances cover Dragapult, Gholdengo, and opposing Hisuian Samurott while Iron Crown's Grass and Fairy resistances cover Rillaboom and Iron Valiant. Ceaseless Edge and Knock Off have impeccable synergy with Future Sight, and Hisuian Samurott's Razor Shell hits Dark-types like Ting-Lu and Kingambit very hard, rendering Iron Crown's Future Sight much more difficult to switch in against. Landorus-T is another great teammate; it also forms a powerful VoltTurn core with Iron Crown, can blanket check most physical attackers with Intimidate and Rocky Helmet to complement Iron Crown's ability to blanket check most special attackers with Assault Vest, can set up Stealth Rock, and the two also boast impeccable defensive synergy courtesy of Iron Crown checking Ice Beam users like Deoxys-S and Landorus-T checking physical Iron Valiant and Heatran. Together, Iron Crown, Hisuian Samurott, and Landorus-T form an extremely powerful core that resists every type in the game, utilizes multiple pivoting options, sets up both Stealth Rock and Spikes, and can blanket check many physical and special attackers alike. Calm Mind Primarina is a good teammate that can run Psychic Noise itself, allowing Iron Crown to more freely run Future Sight, and can take advantage of Iron Crown's ability to wear down teams over time to set up for a late-game sweep once threats like Encore Iron Valiant are dealt with. Physically defensive Moltres is another solid teammate, as it can reliably check most physical attackers by spreading burn with Will-O-Wisp and Flame Body and heavily punishes Dark-types like Kingambit and Hisuian Samurott and Steel-types like Gholdengo aiming to switch into Future Sight, and appreciates Iron Crown's ability to temporarily keep special attackers like Deoxys-S and Walking Wake at bay. Kingambit itself makes for a strong teammate, as with Iron Crown's Future Sight support, Kingambit has a much easier time both finding opportunities to set up with Swords Dance and muscle past physical walls like Dondozo and Alomomola, which are quickly overwhelmed by the combination of Future Sight and powerful Dark-type attacks possibly boosted further by Black Glasses, Tera Dark, and Supreme Overlord. Kingambit additionally resists Ghost- and Dark-type attacks from the likes of Gholdengo and opposing Kingambit lacking Low Kick, which Iron Crown greatly appreciates. Zamazenta and Weavile also greatly appreciate both Iron Crown's Future Sight support and its pivoting capabilities, allowing them to be brought in safely and giving them opportunities to fire off a powerful Body Press or Knock Off that, when paired with Future Sight, can prove nearly impossible to switch in against.</p>"

      "Choice Specs": {
        "description": "<p>Leveraging its high Special Attack and good coverage, Choice Specs Iron Crown is a potent wallbreaker that can 2HKO a number of the metagame's defensive options like Garganacl and Gliscor. Tachyon Cutter being a multi-hit move lets Iron Crown OHKO Focus Sash Glimmora without activating Toxic Debris, break Multiscale on Dragonite, and deal significant damage to Landorus-T. Psyshock is preferred to let Iron Crown take on specially defensive walls like Galarian Slowking, Clodsire, and Blissey, while Psychic Noise can be used instead to prevent Pokemon like Corviknight and Zapdos from healing in front of it. Volt Switch lets Iron Crown pivot out of Pokemon it would otherwise struggle against while also dealing significant damage to the likes of Primarina and Alomomola. Focus Blast helps Iron Crown deal with Steel-types like Kingambit and Iron Treads and is its best option to damage Ting-Lu. Tera Steel increases the power of Tachyon Cutter, letting it 2HKO offensive Gholdengo variants and OHKO fully HP invested Landorus-T most of the time, while Tera Fighting Focus Blast guarantees a 2HKO on Ting-Lu, as well as OHKOes Ogerpon-W most of the time and guarantees an OHKO on Cinderace. Both Tera types also remove Iron Crown's weakness to Dark-type moves, improving its matchup against offensive Dark-types like Kingambit and Hisuian Samurott.</p> <p>Choice Specs Iron Crown needs physically offensive teammates like Zamazenta and Dragonite that can reliably remove specially defensive Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Blissey. In return, they benefit from Iron Crown being able to handle physical walls like Clefable and Dondozo. Because Iron Crown will be consistently locked into one move, it's easier to revenge kill, so it needs defensive teammates such as Primarina and Landorus-T that can switch into faster offensive Pokemon like Darkrai and Roaring Moon while also providing pivot support for Iron Crown. Alomomola is another good teammate for Iron Crown, pivoting it into favorable matchups and keeping it healthy with Wish. Gholdengo is especially annoying for Iron Crown, as it resists both of its STAB moves and can easily heal off damage, so teammates like Kingambit and Great Tusk that can easily take care of it are useful. Finally, Iron Crown benefits from entry hazard setters like Hisuian Samurott that can soften up foes and allow it to clean them up easier.</p>"
